Tiew99,Great experience in Darkness,A memorable experience in full darkness. Marcus was a great guide. Guiding us throughout our darkness experience. In darkness we’re able to concentrate fully on our partner besides getting to experience various type of food presented for us to try. It truly makes our senses and taste bud up trying to figure out what we’re putting into our mouth. An experience worth trying. Will definitely come back in future.,5,2020-02-29,Dining In The Dark KL

"KapiDanKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Delectable Vegetarian Indian Food,"Being an indian in Malaysia, I grew up eating a variety of Indian food and my partner is from India and knows his lentils, curries and indian breads well. However, we like to try Oriental, Western and Mediterranean food when we go out. But on some rare occasions, we would go back to the roots and try a good Indian restaurant, although we choose our 'place-to-eat' carefully :)This past weekend we were craving Indian food. So after a bit of research we decided to try a small cafe in Bangsar called 'Ganga Cafe'. I was not expecting myself to be awed by the food but that changed the moment we tried the appetizer 'Samosa Chaat'. The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy and the crispy samosa chunks was heavenly.My partner had the Channa Bhatura and it was crispy with a tender texture with chana rightly spiced for our palate. I ordered the Parantha with Palak Paneer (Cheese Spinach) and I enjoyed every bite of my tongue tantalizing food. But the best part of our order was this amazing drink called Pranic Juice which just leaves you refreshed and awake after every sip. It is a mixture of mint, lemon and few other ingredients..Bottomline, if you like vegetarian Indian food you should definitely check this place out. It is delicious and value for money too. Enjoy the food!",5,2018-06-02,The Ganga Cafe
Leslie L,Tender Ribeye Pork Steak,"The ambience in this restaurant is very inviting, relaxed and romantic. Service is very good indeed. The ribeye pork steak was tender, succulent but unevenly salted, some parts were too salty. All in all a very nice meal.",4,2018-01-01,Ante

CalebS628KL,Good food but average service,"Firstly, the atmosphere of DC Restaurant is nice and certainly gives you an upmarket feel. We were greeted professionally by the staff and they all seemed to be fairly knowledgeable on what they offer. We had the 5 course menu and I would rank the appetizers and pre-main to be above their main course. My selection for main course was the steak. Hence comparing to other restaurants which predominantly specialize in their meat, DC would come short on that dish. Apart from that, the rest were great. However, one thing worth to mention is the attitude of one particular staff at the restaurant. We ordered a 2012 wine but when the wine arrived it was a 2014. I assumed that they brought the right wine and hence I did not particular note the year stated on the bottle. It was after a glass which I finally picked up the bottle and started looking at it closely. Only to realize they had serve me a 2014 bottle. When I questioned the staff, he said that they have ran out of the 2014. When I asked him why didn't anyone from the floor informed us, he replied me by saying sorry that they forgot to inform us. For that reason, I can't say that the restaurant is fabulous at all. Definitely not the kind of staff you want to have as he basically wiped out all the good things about the restaurant.",4,2016-12-20,DC Restaurant

mafi_slMalaysia,Good spread for a high tea,"Chose to have lunch/ high tea at the essence @ Sheraton, haven't been here in a decade! , remember it having a different name.Since it was a public holiday it was a high tea. visited with friends, family and kids. The day we went it was a superhero themed high tea, the servers were dressed as super heroes and some desserts, cup cakes, , and others had super hero themed decorations. kids loved it! The spread was good, and included sushi, assortment of breads, soup, salads, western, Indian, Malay and Chinese cuisine. The sushi didn't feel very fresh and I feel the rice was a bit under done, the rest of the food was good. Overall good outing and will visit again.",4,2015-09-27,Essence Restaurant

"andyhunt2Huddersfield, United Kingdom",Lovely food and great atmosphere ,We had a lovely meal at this welcoming restaurant serving delicious regional food with an excellent vibe. I enjoyed butter prawns while my wife had lemongrass chicken both were excellently cooked. We just had room for dessert and shared the banana fritter which were fab. Service was prompt and we were well attended to by our waiter Jonathan. While we eat we were entertained with traditional Chinese music. This place is definitely to be recommended. ,5,2020-03-30,Old Shanghai
"muppet911Bristol, United Kingdom",Don't understand the reviews,"I always try to search out good Italian restaurants and it is a little difficult in kl as many are not run by Italians. Opus has always had great reviews and so I thought I would try. I tried several times to just rock up without a reservation and never succeeded ( weekdays - not weekends) so I assumed it must be really good! How wrong. I went with a female friend and we again tried with no reservation and luckily they had a small table for 2 outside, which is no issue. What was an issue is the risotto I ordered, risotto is a basic Italian dish, albeit it does take a little care and attention but this was simply terrible. It was more like Nasi goreng (local fried rice). When I complained the waitress was completely indifferent and didn't show any concern whatsoever.they obviously asked if I wanted to change etc etc but that's not the point. My dining companions food was also very mediocre. And as in usual kl style the dishes arrived 10 or 15 mins apart! This really really annoys me, when you go to dinner WITH someone you want dinner WITH them, not to watch one another eat!! It appears a lot of wealthy locals eat there and I can only guess they don't know any better!",1,2015-06-28,Opus Bistro
"5N0madsLondon, United Kingdom",Needs to be properly cleaned and maintained better,"We have visited this cafe for breakfast many times. This is the second time we have been seated under an air con which drips onto the table and food!!! Unbelievable that this has not been fixed as it has been like this for months.The toilets are not clean and the floors and walls are painted a dirty grey which doesn't mask the dirt, peeling or cracked paint.However, the food and coffee are excellent. Very fresh, tasty, well presented. This is the only reason people are here. Not for the decor or very loud fan noise that permeates the restaurant from the one kitchen. The menu cards are tatty and disgusting though-in need of replacement.",2,2016-04-10,The Red Beanbag
andrew_lkm,Class A Xiao Long Pao!,"Another typical hotel type Chinese restaurant...but they really have one of the best Xiao Long Pao in KL! It's a MUST try.

"The_Traveler010710Shah Alam, Malaysia",Good Steak !,"Second time coming here after many years! We read many recent ‘not so good’ from TA but we still want to have ‘old feeling’ kind of cafe with our young children. We were served by a very friendly & helpful (couldn’t get the name). We ordered the Sirloin Steak, Ribeye, Beef Pulled Burger, Mushroom Soup, Garlic Bread, Cream Brulae, & Banana Fritters with Ice Cream. Ribeye tasted perfect, Sirloin Steak is a bit too rare, the rest just perfect. Dessert : Fried Banana Fritters & Cream Brulae was delicious, simple but .

"songllengPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Regular visitor when craving for Jap.,"Born and bred in Subang, this place is my go-to when I crave jap. The prices are super reasonable for what you get.

"ClosedmouthshowerCape Town Central, South Africa",Lovely Date Night,"Visited this restaurant with my girlfriend. The food was lovely, we both had the salmon, which was cooked really well. Creme brûlée for desert was extremely enjoyable too. The service was efficient and attentive. The restaurant allows corkage if you want to take a good bottle of wine along, which we did. The tranquil atmosphere the restaurant provides in the busy street is enjoyable. I recommend sitting outside to enjoy the atmosphere.Try not to drive in the area of the restaurant, as the roads are congested in the evening over the weekends. Only disadvantage is that it is difficult to find parking. The people purporting to be parking attendants on the street are abrupt and annoying, but this is the area in general.",5,2014-05-30,Pampas Reserve Grill & Bar
"739claudiatSingapore, Singapore",A Gem in Taman Tun neighbourhood,"Amazing food. I realised that the cuisine was Yemeni food which I had not tried before. At first I was apprehensive but my fears melted away when I tasted the spectacular cuisine. We had the chicken hanith, akin to chicken briyani in a stone pot, and the dips @ tanouleh, hummus was amazing. Dessert was Kanuffa and caramel. Kanuffa is like fried microscopic noodles with cheese filling with crushed pistachio nuts sprinkled on top. Atasha the manager was warm and introduced us to the Yemeni food. She came occasionally and infected us with her warm humour and stories.",5,2023-08-10,Bedouin Arabian Cuisine
"Paris1964Paris, France",Very disappointed,"Went all the way from Ampang to Roost for lunch and walked out eventually. First a guy on the pavement shows us a menu (they have to go down on the street to attract customers ?). We go up, order our starters (duck paté and scallop/crab salad) and main courses (chicken and pasta) and wait. After a while, a different waiter comes to tell us the chicken is only available for dinner, and brings back the menu. And we wait.... I mentioned that maybe it would be nice to tell the customers beforehand that a dish is not available, or maybe even mention it on the menu, there's an idea, if it's never available for lunch. Not much reaction, the guy takes the menu away without asking me what else I would like as a main course. I decide to let it go and see if anyone notices there is no second main course ordered. I have to mention that we are the only customers at 12.45 on a Saturday. Paté arrives, ok, nicely presented, average taste, and so does my scallop and crab salad a bit later. I start eating it and just cannot find any trace of scallops. I mention it to the waiter, who laughs, goes to the kitchen and comes back to say ""no scallops so we put extra crab meat"". Not the salad we ordered (and of course no mention of the change to the customer), no main course ordered, the Danish chef witnesses the whole scene and does not make a move to explain, let alone apologize. We decide to walk out, ask for the bill for food and drink consumed (it does come with no argument) and as we go out, we mention our discontent to the chef. His only reply (he is very shy or he really really doesn't care) is, we've not had scallops for 2 months... WHY NOT TELL THE CUSTOMER OR TAKE THE DISH OFF THE MENU ??? We told him that we understand that in Malaysia things don't always come out as they should, but a simple explanation or apology would have made things better when there are such blunders. Even better, get organised and tell the customers what they are going to get (or cannot get) before the order is taken... we really felt he couldn't care less... shame as this was a promising restaurant but we will never set foot in the place again. I can understand this level of service in a cheap eatery, but from a restaurant that considers itself trendy and upmarket, it is more than puzzling. And they do look like they need customers, only two more had arrived when we left at 1.15pm. Others restaurants in the area were packed and we had a lovely lunch with excellent service at Ashley's by Living Foods just up the road.",2,2015-05-30,Roost
"Robert BKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Good tasty meal,"Went to Serendib as we love Sri-Lankan food and had not been back there in 5 years. It is conveniently located in G Tower at the base.

"AngiePBBVancouver, Canada",Dragon - i is one of the best restaurant in this Pavilion Bukit Bintang food court,"We were craving for Peking duck and went to this place for our meal. It was in weekday and early afternoon. They didn't have a lot of patrons, but service was still great, except some wait staff didn't speak English. I read from yelp that they had Peking duck 3 style of dishes (regular crispy skin wraps, meat dish with vegetables, and soup using the remaining meat on the bones), but when we asked, the wait staff told us that was not available, without giving us any explanation. Thus we were disappointed, but still ordered the duck. They sliced the duck in front of us, but they come up with 2 dishes, one with the skin and the other one with meat, together with the wraps in 2 containers, sauces & green onion on two plates. The duck was excellent, just we missed the soup dish. Probably they used it for their soup and sold it to their other customers",5,2023-03-03,Dragon-i Peking Duck Restaurant @ Pavilion KL
"thesij82London, United Kingdom",Tasty food in a nice-looking restaurant,"Grandmama’s is one of many restaurants/eateries inside a large and maze-y shopping mall.Grandmama’s stood out for me due to the appealing decor, nice seating area and, most importantly, it’s menu offering.After some deliberation I opted to go with a beef curry dishes, which was accompanied by coconut juice.The service was relatively quick and courteous. Staff were friendly, attentive but not overly pushy. The food itself was even better. The beef was cooked to perfection - tender and full of flavour. The perfect combination was the fresh coconut water that I washed everything down with. And as with tradition, the coconut water actually comes in a real coconut - which becomes a desert in itself because you are given a spoon to eat the soft flesh inside. Mmmmmm!You can certainly get cheaper beef rendang elsewhere, but I think the cost was relative and preferred the cosy environment. I’m glad I decided to eat here. You should, too!",4,2018-01-06,Grandmama's
"gcatucciKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",We found this place in google,"We found this place in google map, and realized it was right across the street for the 4 Points By Sheraton.I think they changed the menu as we could not find most of the items we saw pictures of on google maps. However, the octopus in a kind of spicy broth was very good and extremely tender.We loved the mushroom (not the omelette you see pictures about).We didn’t really care about the chicken wing, which were deboned and tasteless. However, the red rice that came along with it tasted as a good risotto.The only complaint I have is that for some reason we have to pay separate bills for drinks and food although it’s the same owner. That was very annoying considering the drinks had to paid cash and lucky I had enough on me.",3,2020-12-02,Chocha Foodstore

Other dishes will be add-ons to make the meal complete.As for Wanjor, basically, the rice is the same as other places. But to dine in here will make the meal interesting and more enjoyable. As you can choose your dishes from a variety of other add-ons dishes that are prepared on the spot, freshly cooked and direct from the wok like the fried chicken parts.The sambal is slightly on the sweeter side.

"Eric DKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Extremely poor service,"I made the mistake of dining there yesterday. Service was random, with a number of waiters standing idle next to the wall while patrons were desperately trying to get attention. Once I placed my order, all the dishes and drinks were practically shoved onto my table in no particular order, as if they needed to get rid of me asap. I believe they gave me a dish that had been sent back by another customer. Finished my ""fine"" dinner in 25 minutes. That's ok, I will not come again.

"pauljerSingapore, Singapore",It's all a-okay,"Big menus are commonplace in Malaysia. The menu at Annie1 looks longer than the complete musings of Confucius.Famous Menglembu wanton mee is absurdly satisfying: They are the very definition of joyous slurp. The noodles are springy and the charsiews are the star of the dish. There is no way to eat this food elegantly so don’t bother trying. Just get your mouth over the plate, lift the noodles and suck. Festoon yourself in napkins tucked into every crevice of your clothing as if you are trying to mitigate the impact of a blast zone, which in a way you are. I was also moved to speechlessness by their Chee cheong fun pork curry – this is a good place to try these rice noodle roll.Yes, the food is also deliciously affordable.

"Dato-AdnanKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Missing Roasted Peanuts in my Nasi Lemak,"IntroductionNasi Lemak is a Malay cuisine of fragrant rice (cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf). A basic traditional Nasi Lemak dish (which I grew up with since I was able to eat spicy food 60 years ago) is served with hot spicy sauce (sambal), fried small anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, half hard-boiled egg and a few slices of fresh cucumber. It is commonly sold wrapped in banana leaf. In time, Nasi Lemak has turned into a substantial plated meal served with other side dishes such as ayam goreng (fried chicken), sambal sotong (cuttlefish in hot spicy sauce), sambal kerang (cockles in hot spicy sauce) and rendang daging (beef cubes stewed in coconut milk and spices) to name a few. Once, merely a breakfast fare, commonly sold at hawker food centres and roadside stalls, Nasi Lemak has grown into popularity and now served in restaurants and hotels as a noon or evening meal. Nasi Lemak has since grown into a dish that could be eaten all day.Nasi Lemak WanjoAfter having heard and read many reviews, both positive and negative, about the Nasi Lemak served at the Nasi Lemak Wanjo restaurant, I finally decided to give it a try and visited the establishment on Tuesday 25 July 2023. The Nasi Lemak Wanjo restaurant, which is located in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur is an open-air restaurant with a roof over your head and plenty of fans to cool and ventilate the restaurant. There is an air-conditioned room where you could dine in but for a price of RM1 per head. The restaurant is relatively clean. It also has 4 toilets which were relatively clean as well. Service is fast and staff very friendly.My wife and I ordered a plate of Nasi Lemak each (which came with all the mandatory condiments but minus the roasted peanuts). I rate it as an incomplete Nasi Lemak dish which I would have just binned if it was for a Nasi Lemak competition.There were like ten other side dishes to choose from. My wife ordered begedil (deep fried potato patty) and paru-paru goreng (deep fried slices of cow lungs) to accompany her Nasi Lemak. I had rendang limpa (a slice of spleen stewed in coconut milk and spices) and sambal kerang (cockles in hot spicy sauce) to accompany mine. We both had Teh Tarik to go with our Nasi Lemak.The Nasi Lemak was average. The rice lacked the sweet fragrance and tasted less coconutty. The sambal was hot (as it should be) but unfortunately too sweet. The fried ikan bilis, half hard-boiled egg and slices of fresh cucumber were fine. But I felt a bit upset that roasted peanuts were not served with the Nasi Lemak. The begedil was good. The paru-paru goreng slices were fine but a bit too tough to bite into (probably overfried). The rendang limpa slices were fien but a bit too chewy (probably undercooked). The sambal kerang was also unfortunately too sweet. The Teh Tarik was just right. Neither too bitter nor too sweet. The whole meal cost us RM31.00 which I considered reasonable.Overall, I rate the Nasi Lemak served at Nasi Lemak Wanjo Restaurant as plain and average, as I have eaten better Nasi Lemak elsewhere. The Nasi Lemak should have been cooked and served top notch as it is the star of the show. If the Nasi Lemak has been super good, one does not need any side orders to complement it.If you are looking for a nice ambience to dine in, the restaurant will do fine. But if you are looking for a mouth-watering good old traditional Nasi Lemak then you will feel somewhat let down. The missing roasted peanuts in my Nasi Lemak dish left me somewhat disappointed.",3,2023-07-27,Nasi Lemak Wanjo

Not a bad way to spend your lunch on rainy days having warm soup in your stomach.

"BL_LeoPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Very good burnt cheesecake ,"Burnt cheesecake is made by the Basque country, particularly San Sebastian where it is said that a little incident by a baker in the kitchen led to the global sensation when the burnt cheesecake has taken the world over by storm. In Malaysia alone, many cafes and restaurants offer this dessert to those with sweet tooth. I have tried most of the places I'd known but the Japanese version in The Tokyo Restaurant, tucked on the 4th floor of Lot 10 KL.. remained elusive as I hardly go downtown. My opportunity came when I had to meet a customer in downtown KL one weekday and I utilised the time in between to give this place a try. There is a lift outside the mall that gives direct access to the 4th floor where many Japanese restaurants have set their foot here. Since it was a weekday afternoon, the place was almost empty so we could dine in peace. The whole restaurant setup was modern and tastefully decorated with warm ambience - perfect to kill some free time and to enjoy your food or dessert or even a cup of coffeeThey do serve limited food such as salad, sushi, burger, etc but since I was there for one thing only, I couldn't comment much on these.I ordered their famous burnt cheesecake - so famous that I could spot many Instagram featuring it. At RM20 per piece, it's probably the most expensive piece of cake I'd ever tried in my life. The cake was served lying down on the plate with a dollop of whipped cream on top. It was soft yet bold, with rich cheese taste that cheese lovers would appreciate, or else it would be too rich for general palates. It instantly melt as soon as it entered the mouth. Perhaps the whipped cream's purpose was to mellow down the cheesiness of the cake and it certainly did a good job at that. Iced latte did its job to satisfy my caffeine needs.. using premium coffee beans hence the premium price charged After that we took a while to look around the refurbished Lot 10 - many establishments such as Sushi Azabu, Dashing Dining Says, etc... That I have not even stepped into yet. Time to discover more about it next time. For now.. it's a yes just to come and taste the famous burnt cheesecake.",5,2019-05-10,THE TOKYO RESTAURANT.

Aptly called 'The Grand Getaway', the whole set-up brings us back to a real airport experience that we all have missed - from the familiar tune for announcements in the airport and sitting on an actual aeroplane seat. This dining experience invites us to enjoy a 5-course meal in five countries by igniting our senses with special videos played on the digital screen placed around the hotel's grand ballroom with special sound and light effects.This special trip takes us to Tokyo, New York, Moscow, Istanbul and back to Kuala Lumpur - places we definitely can't wait to visit in real. In each country, we are served with the country's special dish.My personal favourite was the dish from Istanbul and a Malaysian dessert (no spoilers given haha).The whole dinner takes about 2-hour and I was fully occupied with non-stop entertainment and was busy shooting videos or taking pictures of the unique experience to share on social media. In my personal opinion, this is not just the most instagrammable restaurant but it's an intelligent way to have dine-in at the hotel's grand ballroom with a grand setting and with proper social distancing arrangements.Well done to the organising team!I'll definitely bring my work colleagues and family to enjoy this experience.",5,2021-10-07,The Grand Getaway by Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur

While reading feedback can be either of the spectrum so a hit or miss for diners. It is a gastrobar so if you come in and treat it as fine dining you will be disappointed.

"yalmunasMuscat, Oman",Old facility that needs updating soon,"I had breakfast in the Mill Café while staying in the GMKL. The breakfast had a good spread of Asian and Western food with a verity of fresh cut fruit and chilled juices. Breads and pastries were also available and were good. The breakfast also included pancakes and waffles. There were a few problems with the breakfast, and I hope the Mill Café management will attend to these problems. The problems in the breakfast were as follows;1. At the café entrance, I had to give the café reception staff my room number. It looked like he had a printed log of room occupants. He also had a Computer in front of him that he used to print a registration form of multiple copies. I had to write my name, room number and sign this form. I do not know why I had to write this on the form when the Computer had this information and could have printed it. I also do not know why is the whole form needed when he had a log of room occupants. This is a lot of waste and causes time delays.2. The seating area is very dated, with very old carpets. In some areas there is marble flooring instead of carpets. The marble flooring is of Chocolate color (dark brown color), the ceiling panels are of Chocolate color, the tables and chairs are of Chocolate color and the wall wooden panels & dividers are also of Chocolate color. This is very dark and very depressing.3. The made to order eggs station had one cook who would prepare one order at a time, with each order taking the cook about 5 minutes. There were only 3 people ahead of me, but this meant that I would have to wait 15 minutes just to give my egg order. Luckily, another cook came to assist the existing cook to make eggs. 4. For Western breakfasts, there were no grilled tomatoes or sautéed mushrooms to go with the eggs. They did have hash browns, by the way.5. There are more people having breakfast during weekends, and the Mill Café staff were struggling to clean and service the tables.I hope the Mill Café management will upgrade the Mill Café facilities soon.",3,2017-05-25,The Mill Cafe

"MicLawMLKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Awesome Food!,"People always say that the way to gauge how good the food is at an eatery is by looking at the crowd. It is not always true but this time, the massive crowd spoke the truth!Despite the crowd, the service staff were excellent regardless whether they were waiters, servers, cashiers or captains. Everyone was attentive, efficient, accommodating, courteous and knowledgeable about the food offerings.The food was served quite quickly and while they were steaming. The roast duck was succulent, tender and seasoned perfectly. The roast pork (siew yoke) was tender and tasty with light, crispy skin. And the barbecued roast pork (char siew) was heavenly; tender, nicely caramelized but not too sweet and devoid of ghastly red coloring.The wantan noodles were al dente and deliciously coated with meat juices. The fried rice cooked in lotus leaves was reminiscent of rustic home cooking; pure comfort food.Other mentionable offerings we had was the steamed pork with salted fish, stewed pork & yam ('kau yoke' so tender, it melted in the mouth!), clam soup (xiong tong lala), stir fried beans in shrimp paste (belacan) and a braised homestyle tofu.That was one of the best meals we have had this year.

Started with the Lou Sang with the senior waitress explaining the significance of each ingredient. We then had the Peking duck - they made the pancakes for us, so not quite as tasty. Following that, the service deteriorated with the subsequent dishes coming out very slowly. The taufu was tasty, as was the beef on a hot plate. We then had the noodles with duck and the Chinese sausages with rice. After at least 20 minutes later, the fish dish came out, just when we thought we were finished! The restaurant was packed, so that may be the reason why the service was so slow, both with the dishes coming out and with the waiters re-filling tea/changing dirty plates.

I fell in love with their coffees and teas everyday. Since this was located very close to our hotel, it made it so easier for us to go there everytime we needed some food. The pricings weren't bad at all and we all know how cheap the food is in Malaysia. The restaurant had enough seating space. The staff are always helpful and very attentive to whatever our needs were. The staff went out of their way to help us out everytime we were there. We were so glad that we had this restaurant closer to our hotel. The cleanliness and the quality of the meals were very good.

"Alan OPetaling Jaya, Malaysia","""The Best Steaks in Malaysia""","Four days ago, my daughter insisted that we celebrate my birthday dinner at The Steakhouse in KL as we are steak lovers. It was our first visit there.We were in for a big and beautiful surprise from the moment we stepped in as the staff made us feel very welcomed. Even though this isn't your typical fine-dining western establishment, the staff were so well-trained, polite, and professional. While ordering our food, Jubert, our waiter for the evening, suggested that we try the Black Angus Pure Certified Australian Angus Beef Medallion, it was so good. The next course we ordered was the Steak Bordelaise (to be cooked medium rare, of course!), never knew that such great steaks were available in Kuala Lumpur. Of course, the chef cooked the steaks to perfection, so kudos to the chef. Throughout dinner, the staff made sure that we were comfortable and not neglected at any moment. Superb service. Our bread basket was even replenished with a fresh one mid-way through our meal. After devouring our delicious meaty dishes, Jubert surprised me with a complimentary Werner's Special from the dessert menu as a birthday treat. It made for a sweet and refreshing way to end our already wonderful meal. Our special sincere appreciation and thanks to Jubert, for making our dinner a great one and my birthday very ""Special and Memorable"".We will always come back here for the best steaks and excellent service.Thank you.",5,2019-05-19,The Steakhouse KL
"BL_LeoPetaling Jaya, Malaysia",Affordable French fine dining at its best,"Value for money French fine-diningThere's a reason why Entier is always booked out for their lunch sessions - good food with affordable pricing. And I only found out about this when she directed me to the obscure part of Brickfields where Alila Bangsar (technically the building is in Brickfields area but with a connecting bridge to Bangsar LRT station). ""Atceli I tried to book for many weeks already but it was always fully-booked"" she said. My heart melted when I got to know how she went through the hassle to surprise me, as I know the fact that she isn't very much a planner herself. Located on the 41st floor, we got ourselves a table by the window overseeing Brickfields and beyond. I kepoh a bit and took a look around - the restaurant was definitely full house and everyone was seen enjoying their lunch over chatters. Complimentary bread with kombu butter (which was heavenly by the way) was served as soon as we placed our order. I had to order a second kombu butter because it was so good. So there are two (2) options: 2-Course (RM108) without dessert or 3-Course Lunch Set (RM128) with dessert. Starters  Garlic & Escargot Soup - garlic veloute (soup); vegetable stock; escargot beignet; garlic croutons. So the escargot was deep fried with greenish colour dough on the outside and served on the plate which covered the bowl of soup. The idea was to pour everything into the soup and enjoyed like that. Salmon & Katsuo - cured Norwegian salmon tartare, nage of Katsuo, kombu dashi, salmon roe. Delicious but I could not help but to think that it tasted more Japanese than French. Mains Duck & Potato - duck confit Parmentier, mushroom, mashed potato and crispy tuile. I was impressed by the presentation of the dish. All elements combined well together to make my tummy happy. Butter Fish - butter fish beignet; sauteed pea sprout; mashed potato; pickled pearl onion. I took a bite and still prefer my duck dish. Given the choice, I'd normally go for red meat as main. The pickled onion did its job to cut through the richness of the sauce. Desserts Banana Éclair - banana eclair; 70% single Pahang chocolate cream, yoghurt ice cream. I wouldn't order banana dessert if not for the other half who wanted to try it. Lovely dessert which was not too sweet yet got me wanted for more. Each set comes with complimentary tea/coffee or homemade kombucha (soda). Lunch Hour Wine Specials @ RM60 nett for any 2 glasses of white (Italian verdicchio), red (negroamaro) or pink sparkling (rose brut).Lunch was good, the companion was beautiful and most importantly, we left the restaurant satisfied with the overall food quality and service.

"RonRuffKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",THE PERFECT SALAD!,"I usually ordered the Chicken Barbecue salad for a late lunch with a couple of toasted garlic bread slices. However, today this salad, along with the service could not be beat! The salad filled my plate, not only huge chunks of barbecue chick pieces, but stripped with the barbecue sauce and grated Parisian cheese, even the lip of the plate told the story. Usually I have this big wonderful salad with a couple of toasted garlic bread, but this time I chose the platter with sliced Italian bread covered in mozzarella cheese, thick, gooey, melted over fresh sliced mushrooms. OMG, I thought I was going to die! The most wonderful lunch I have ever had! You gotta try this with a taste of their wonderful selection of beer or soft drink of your choice, the taste, the amount, the falvor, the service...Nothing could have been better!

That's certainly the restaurant's prerogative, but I'd not go again if made to sit out in the middle jumble even though I'd reserved far in advance and requested the other seating.

"jcyhSeremban, Malaysia",Nice Ambience,"Had a small meeting with my colleagues here. Owners were kind enough to loan us the Cigar Room, provided we ordered a certain value of food/drinks. This place a little bit unique in a sense that the place is litter with pictures of jazz musicians (Miles Davis, Dizzy Gilesppe, Sinatra, etc.), and for those who are hifi equipment enthusiasts, there stuff like McIntoshs, Sonus Faber & JBL speakers. Mytek digital source was used but most stuff (including reel to reel) were on static display only. Place was relatively quite, especially in the Cigar Room, and as we were having a meeting, this was perfect. Food was served promptly, with no fuss. Ordered sandwiches, coffee and tea, tasty but nothing great. Lunch menu is a bit limited. Pasta, pizza, burgers...soups, salads, the usual Mediterranean/Italian/Western fare. One part of the this place which can do better is the food menu, I think. Coffee, late, capuccinos were ok. Didn't try the wine(in meeting, remember?), though I can see that the displays/racks were full of varieties. The deserts were good and there's a variety to chose from.Our time spent there was from 11am to afternoon. Place was very nice to have a chat. Music was soft and pleasant. I suppose the evening crowd/dinner the atmosphere could be more rowdy.All in all. Had a nice meeting there. Ok food and drinks.

The durian is fresh and always up to our expectations.Finding parking is easy as it is at the corner of central SS2. They sell fresh coconut as beverage and Durian Chendol as dessert too. We always opt for the fresh coconut and even go for seconds. The staff are always friendly and are patient with us finding the right durian for us (kinda like finding the right engagement ring for the occasion ).

Was really grateful for that!Heard of this place for quite some time before actually trying it out recently. I'm glad I actually tried as I'm smitten already. The range of meat was really good especially for carnivores like me! :D You can have all the sausages, bacon, pork chops, steaks and salmon (sashimi grade) for your picking. Not forgetting they have a very nice range of salads to choose from too. Always preferred Medium done for my steak but many places would have ""over done"" it. My steak was grilled to perfection here. And their bacon was really good with a nice crisp and not salty like most places! Also tried their Pomelo Salad and it really complimented the meat. The staff provided excellent service in taking our orders, assisting to choose the meat and providing suggestions for the salads available.Am really impressed that such a small place provided such excellent service that's even above some 5 star hotels or restaurants.

Personally, I find that the seats near the windows (with the current weather in Msia, it is too hot) is not comfortable. I'd rather be seated further from the sun. Anyway, there were 5 of us and we paid RM305 (inclusive of GST). We ordered 2 of the hi-tea sets (includes 2 trays of food & 2 pots of darjeeling tea) & a cup of cafe latte (RM25).

We told her the beer order and she finally took out the headphones because she could not hear us over her music and said ""what?"". We were tempted to just walk out after this very poor welcome, but we had walked a long way to come here, so we stuck it out. We were the only table there and we stayed for nearly two hours. The atmosphere was dead, as there was no music or customers. The girl with the headphones connected her phone to the speaker and we had music for around 20 mins....but then she left and we had nothing.

"DaveThompson16Ampang, Malaysia",Warmed up pre-prepared food,"My wife and I were apprehensive when we looked at the online menu, which is enormous. Far too many options. How could the chefs possibly freshly prepare such a wide variety of dishes? Well, the answer is, they don't.We booked a table in advance, but when we got there they had no record of our booking. Anyway, the place was empty so no problem. While we were looking at our menus, a waitress came over and asked if we were ready. We said yes, and she picked up the menus and walked away without taking our order! Eventually I got to order the lamb shepherd's pie with chips and peas. The pie was what you would expect to find in a downmarket supermarket's frozen section. The peas were mushy (by design) but not as they should have been. Best part of the meal was the gravy. My wife ordered the cod and chips and a side order of onion rings. Not sure what the fish was, but it wasn't cod. Telapia maybe. Cream coloured mushy flesh, not white and flaky. Yeugh!Service was below average. I asked for a fork and was presented with a pint of Tiger. They even tried to charge us for that later on!Valuewise, the food is not cheap, and poorly prepared. We both felt a bit ill later on. The location is good though, and the ambience is ok.Sometimes I feel like I'm reviewing a different restaurant to everyone else. Definitely not recommended.

"jmptripsKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",I found a new GEM in KL!,"After a 40-minute attempt, including 28 phone dialing’s to make a reservation…I GAVE UP…and I am SO GLAD that I did…in my attempt to eat at Restaurant “X” elsewhere in KL.Super frustrated, I searched TripAdvisor for an alternate FRENCH RESTAURANT. AS A former 3.5-year resident of Paris, I was craving a few things…1) great TRADITIONAL French food, 2) a place to grab that nice meal on a casual Saturday and 3) to treat two friends after a year of Covid-mania! Our reservation for three was made a week ahead of time. We entered at 12:30, first one’s there and were given a table we did not like. “May we change tables please?” “Yes…how about the window?”…YES nicer! HAMMER HAMMER HAMMER! The hammering next door was on the other side of the wall (reno of the next-door shop)…and we asked them to have them stop…and they did! RELEIVED!The space has a large main dining space and a somewhat separate bar are. The wood floors, bright white walls showcasing colorful art, and rich red velour dividing curtains make for a bright, and comfortable space.Seeing that my friend owns a fine wine import business in KL, he surprised me with two very nice French reds, 2013 and 2014 Bordeaux! The corkage fee is RM80 per bottle and we had some nice wine so worth it. We two arrived first while our third trailed us a bit, so we had some Pellegrino and opened a bottle of wine to let it breath. The Lunch menu has TWO fixed-prix menus, PLUS ala carte, plus a large wine and drinks list. The fixed RM140 menu is truly an offering of a starter, main course and a desert. The second RM170 fixed menu offers a starter, a main with a bit extra RM for three of the mains (a bit sneaky we thought). A lovely bread and Pesto Olive Oil dip were brought…perhaps a bit too late.We all three ordered a la carte…as we wanted to try some other things to share like the ratatouille (we ordered to share among three, perfect!). Our selections:We shared two orders of the Ratatouille and a large Pellegrino.1) Lobster Bisque > the Larger Wagyu steak w potatoes and gravy > Crepes Suzette > Double Espresso2) French Onion Soup Souffle > Lobster Ravioli > Crepes Suzette > An Espresso3) French Onion Soup Souffle > the Larger Wagyu steak > Crepes Suzette > A Double SambucaALL the dishes were delicious…the service staff, neatly dressed in black, were attentive, friendly, and responsive. My meal arrived a bit on the cold side and I sent it back for a fast zap, something to address. We were at our table from 12:30 to 3:00 and never felt rushed…until we were admittedly a bit surprised to learn that the kitchen closing at 3:00pm meant we also had to evacuate the premises…while still having sambuca or wine or espresso still to consume. The time frames painted on the front door perhaps needs editing. We were welcome to finish our drinks on the front terrace, which we did, while we ordered a grab home.I would definitely consider this ONE OF THE VERY BEST MEALS that I have enjoyed in 6+ years in KL.I will definitely return. The menu’s appeal means that it is likely meal options, water, wine and coffees may make a small dent in the wallet, so choose wisely and savor the meal.",5,2021-04-11,2OX Two Ox
"ChristopherT2549Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Unique Outlet, Great Value...","Dined here on multiple occassions with family and friends, food and service has always been consistently good. Located within Mov Hotel, take the lift to the Basement or choose to slide down to the outlet via an interesting slide located in the lobby!About everything we sampled tasted great, with our dishes being fired and prepared a la minute from their compact, yet well laid out kitchen. Selection of sausages were amazing, with enough options for most people’s tastebuds. Other items displayed in their showcase included the Wagyu Beef steaks and the ‘must-try’ Wagyu Bone Marrow, roasted and served on a delectable bed of truffle-infused mashed potatoes, a remarkable creation. Selection of their small plates items were also good, we had a variety comprising of lamb, fish, sausages etc while waiting for the mains. Beverage menu was comprehensive enough, covering bottled beer from various countries, a decent selection of wines and liquor, imported soda and other kid-friendly beverages. We also sampled few of the pastas, Black Angus Schnitzel, Wagyu Beef, seafood paella, variety of sausages (served either on a bun or with sides), Mac and Cheese and rounded it off with the House dessert, a delectable, albeit sinful creation by their Chef!Overall experience was very satisfying. For the amount and quality of food/ drinks we had, I believe it was good value for money, considering the locality of the outlet.

"JacqoipengKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Chinese restaurant near Chinatown,"Pik Wah Restaurant is a very old Chinese restaurant which serves typical Cantonese cuisine with not much frills. There are a few dishes which are highly recommended in this restaurant which I find them really good; 1. Steamed village chicken...the sauce & the ginger condiment that comes with the dish goes so well with the chicken. 2. Stir fried prawn is also very yummy if you like prawns. It's called si yau wong prawn. Prawns are big & fresh too.3. If you like fish , they have the deep fried talapia which is good with fried ginger 4. If you prefer something not fried , try the steamed fish with a bottle of rice wine..served in a clay pot...tastes so good with the rice wine 5. We also ordered the fried taufoo with minced pork gravy .On weekends , they also provide complimentary red bean soup for dessert.

But the crab were still flavourful. Claypot Tofu: Gravy was just nice. Not too salty and it goes well with the accompanied vegetables.

"Mdlim24Oakland, California",Excellent local hawker,"This is one of the best Hawker Centers I've been to. I've been to a couple in Singapore, but ICC Pudu has so much good food concentrated in this market. My advice is walk around and look at all the dishes the locals are ordering and eating. If you aren't sure where they got it, they are happy to point you to the hawker stall they got it from. The best part is being that this is a ""locals"" food spot, no meals are more that $2.50 US. Crazy cheap and so much delicious food.But just fair warning, KL is hot and humid. ICC Pudu is no different. I don't care how many fans there are it's still hot.A couple things I tried:Yellow Rice Wine Chicken Buns: these are similar to the flavor of pork buns but even better. These little bundles of joy are at Chef Ming's in hawker stall G-29. They were so good, I took an order for the road when I left.Feng Yang: I tried the Wan Tan Mee with bbq pork. It was really tasty, a little light on the meat though. Along with the dish I got a hot bowl of won ton soup. I was already a hot, sweaty mess before I ate the hot Wan Tan Mee and soup. But after I ate these items, I was sweating like Ime Udoka the first time he spoke to Nia Long after the Celtics suspended him. ICC Pudu is a must to see how the KL locals eat.",5,2022-12-08,ICC Pudu
"385charlottedKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Could not order mineral water.,"Was there attending a family members wedding reception,which means we were upstairs in the private dining area. There was an upsetting event that happened that night. I ordered a glass of water or bottled water for my 6 year old downstairs at the bar and the guy in the bar said I need to order it upstairs (where our dinner was held). So I went up and ordered and I clearly said I don’t mind paying, and the supervisor told me “ you are not allowed to order anything that is outside of what is already arranged for the dinner”. Please note that they were only serving wine and lemongrass water for the dinner. Please also note that they were serving mugs of beer that was being paid for on Cash on Delivery Basis. You can just imagine my shock to what the Supervisor said to me. Water. A simple order which I intend to pay was rejected. Yet they could serve beer? What nonsense! I had to go the the seafood restaurant next door to buy water for my kid. Can you just imagine all that spicy food and you cannot get a hold of water? After highlighting my concerns to the organizer only then we got some bottled water and that was around 8pm. The dinner started at 7pm. For a restaurant with many awards it is shameful that this could even happen. ——————————-The Food : It was alright but not great. Tom Yum soup stood out the most. I absolutely loved it. The rest of the food choice was alright but not great. So I feel that it’s not worth it at all because the same quality can be found at a standard Thai restaurant. If posh Thai food and service is what you’re looking for, then by all means please go ahead.The Service:Despite the one unpleasant event that night, the staff in general were helpful and courteous. They were attentive, however, I feel like they were undermanning. There were 6 tables and I only saw 3-4 servers. Maybe something the management can work on? The ambience:The interior design is beautiful. The restaurant itself has a dim-lit romantic vibe going on and it gives you a luxurious feel. The Ladies Room: Is well kept and clean.

Having already tried the room service and been blown away by that itself I was v excited to try Kwee Zeen. We went 3 x in total and I’m so sad we couldn’t go more!The service is next to none. Far up with Michelin rated restaurants and the creme de le creme of Dubai, where people get a high standard everywhere so the finest in Dubai is mind blowing. The restaurant, can be slightly over bearing. It is colourful but this suits the purpose of providing breakfast to guests as well as morphing into a restaurant in the evening for the hotel so I took it with a pinch of salt. The drinks were divine. I’m fussy. I enjoy a sour mojito with ginger ale which I got right first time round, happy Saj! The food. Wow. Where do I start the lamb is cooked to perfect and presented so beautifully. The burgers were my kids favourite and the puddings were like no other. I cannot rave enough about this restaurant. Everything was 100% perfection and I’m just so sad that Malaysia is so far I can’t go whenever I want. Definitely a dining experience I’ll remember forever. The restaurant manager was ever so attentive and lovely and added that touch of care knowing how comfortable we found the staff, restaurant and the food.

Risotto is one of my favorite Italian dishes but it is so hard to find a good one. I was delighted to find that I really enjoyed the Chicken and mushroom risotto at Michelangelo's. It was al dente and not too watery. I’ll definitely be coming back for this again. A favourite Italian dessert of mine is the tiramisu and it is quite lovely here - the sponge is nicely soaked and balanced with mascapone - definitely one of the better tiramisus I’ve tasted. The burnt cheesecake is another good option for dessert - texturally smooth, with a hint of lemon and not overly burnt, which I prefer.",5,2020-10-13,Michelangelo’s Restaurant @ Solaris Mont’ Kiara

"Maria TMakati, Philippines",Just average and not as Majestic.,"We went here for the Sunday brunch. Service was really good. They were really nice and attentive. But I was not really amaze with the food. I think it says a lot if my favourite will be the fried chicken among the options. Ive been to different buffet brunch, maybe I was just expecting so much since it was recommended by a friend and I heard a lot of good things about The Majestic Hotel, they said royalties come here all the time. Anyway, Japanese option is not that big. Tho the sashimi is good quality. I was expecting different types of sushi rolls. And for the meat, they only had lamb as option (I was really looking forward for some beef). They have a wide options for local dishes, as expected. Over all, I think it's just right for the price -110MYR. Additional 70MYR for the wine option. Should I return? Maybe, but to check the other restaurants in the hotel. ",3,2018-03-06,Contango

The beef curry rice is another let down. Portion of beef is not generous and curry is not up to par. Had better Japanese curry don rice at more affordable place.

"spark41Copenhagen, Denmark",disappointing,"We went to Senja at the Saujana Hotel for their Sunday bubbly brunch after reading fantastic reviews on a local expat blogger's page - don't believe everything you read there! The service was perfunctory at best. Considering Senja is supposed to be an Italian restaurant of some repute, the food certainly didn't live up to that. The appetizers were mainly roasted vegetables and mixed pizza slices, there was a plate of smoked salmon but no capers, lemon slices or onions. The pasta station consisted of 3 types of very ordinary pasta and 3 sauces. There were some quite nice main dishes, a fish particularly good, as was the roast beef - but chicken lasagne!!. The grill station consisted of lamb sausages, skewered prawns and lamb chops. The breads were excellent as was the Prosecco, but there are many other restaurants who produce a much more exciting lunch than here and cheaper too.",3,2014-02-04,Senja Restaurant

"SavvyOzSydney, Australia",DELICIOUS FOOD WORTH QUEUING UP FOR,"Local knowledge is priceless, especially when it comes to tips on the best places to eat. I would not have discovered the delights of Nirwana without recommendations from two young Malaysian ladies on flight to Kuala Lumpur from Sydney. You have to try the best banana leaf food in KL they urged. There will be queues, they warned. Sri Nirwana Maju Restaurant, as it is known, is at 43 Jalan Telawi 3, in Bangsar area of KL, a short cab ride from Sentral. It’s a down to earth establishment nestled among some of the classy joints in this upmarket area. It’s open from 11am to past midnight Yes, there was a queue, but not long, as we got there about noon. But the wait is put to good use as staff hand out menus, and are happy to explain various dishes. Once decided, they take your order and you wait aside. We had a 15 minutes wait in total, not bad considering it was Sunday. By the time you are called to your table, the food soon follows. The choice is huge; lamb, beef, chicken, seafood to vegetarian specialities. We ordered one of the house speciality, fish head curry with white rice, and chicken biryani as the second choice. Each comes with a selection of vegetables, pickles, dhal (lentils), papadum and fried bitter melon slices in red batter. We had fresh lime juice to wash it all down. You can go for fresh coconut or choose from a variety of fruit juices, or lassis, yogurt-based drinks. The food, which is South Indian, was delicious and every bit worth queuing up for.

"M30_MOLLYKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Incompetent Staff & Terrible Service,"I had personally walked into the restaurant to book a table for my family of 5 adults & 3 kids two days prior with someone named Masturah. Then a day before our reservation, someone from the restaurant called me to reconfirm and again i reiterated the no. of pax including adults & kids. I was reminded that they hold the table for 15 minutes only and if we were later than that the table would be given to other guests as they were full. On that day, we arrived sharp at 3pm for our Afternoon Tea, however we were told that our table was not ready as two lunch guests were still having their lunch at the table that we reserved. That was fine with us, however until 3.30pm we were still waiting at the lobby with no indication from the restaurant staff as to when we could be seated although the restaurant was more than three quarter empty! Then upon several enquiries, we were shown to the table, however there was a shortage of 3 seats! Once again the staff lied to us that they were fully booked hence we have to wait or we will be shown to a table situated upstairs of the restaurant. We were baffled because the restaurant was quite empty and they could have easily moved us to another table that was available which were in fact many.The staff were very incompetent and were pointing fingers at each other which was unprofessional. Then after some time they managed to combine another small table to allow us to be seated. This was all pretty embarrassing for us and for a YTL's property! Plus no apologies were forthcoming from them for making us wait for 30minutes!That was not the end of the nightmare for us as our first batch of savoury food took another 30minutes to be served which was after 4pm! This was totally unacceptable for us especially when there were only a total of 6 tables including ours that were occupied in the whole restaurant.Each time we request for a refill it took them forever to prepare and serve, so much so that we left by 5pm because it was getting ridiculous for a renowned restaurant to be so unprofessional and incompetent.In the end it was a total waste of time and money for us as we quickly had the food that was made available and left without refills. When making payment we were asked for feedback, I had voiced out the shortcomings and instead of genuinely apologising, the restaurant's assistant manager Eddy gave us excuses that they are new hence the kitchen was slow in preparing food and is not used to handling such 'big crowds' which was a total of 6 tables only! This is unacceptable to me! My family and I were kind of embarrassed by the episode that we had to endure that got us thinking 'perhaps we were treated in such manner because we were coloured people?'.I've dined at other YTL hotels in KL before and have always had a good experience. This is the worst ever and we are not stepping foot in this hotel / restaurant again!As for the food, most of the savoury items are deep fried and the desserts were too sweet with limited choice. The decent items were the coffee, sausage roll, curry puff, and biscotti. I've tasted better Afternoon Tea elsewhere therefore will not be coming back!",2,2018-01-08,Brasserie 25

"Susan LKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Great weekend brunch with varied Japanese spread,"I had dinner at Kogetsu a couple of months ago and found out that they do weekend buffet brunch. As I had enjoyed my dinner there (though pricey), I thought weekend buffet lunch would allow me to sample even more of their dishes at a fixed price. What I think pushes Kogetsu a notch up compared to other Jap buffets is that it's ala carte buffet, your orders are freshly cooked. The quality of the sashimi was fresh (5 types to choose from, though we find dinner cuts even better) and you get a variety of cooking styles dishes to choose from grilled, teppan, simmered, deep fry, menrui, rice and rolls etc. This is a pure Jap cuisine buffet, no fillers like local and western dishes to deviate your attention from Jap :-p. Though the price does seem steep (there's 20% discount with major credit cards), I do opined that it's still good value for money. Our faves were perfectly grilled eel, teppan hotate (super large!) and lightly battered tempura prawns and soft shell. Good ambiance and service was a plus too. Will definitely return.",4,2016-04-23,Kogetsu Japanese Restaurant

Managed by Banyan Tree, the menu choices are outstanding and truly Malaysian. We were with a cruise ship tour group but many of the fellow diners were staying in the hotel. The seafood is to kill for. My only complaint is that the Peking Duck remnants were not monitored by the cooking staff so all that was left were bones and a few scraps of cold meat. Service was very good and fast. They even have ice cream choices for the kids (and adults of course). Dining is available in or outdoors.

"autumnsnowySingapore, Singapore","Just, OK.","I brought a guest from Germany to this restaurant on a Tuesday night around 9.30pm. We tried the Summer Omakase, signature black cod fish and sake. The food is honestly, just average. Nothing to rave about. The only item that was good was the dessert - chocolate lava cake and ice cream (not sure how can this go wrong). In summary, we were very disappointed with the quality of the food and service given the price point. The waiter of our table wasn’t attentive at all. We had to catch the waiter’s attention on a regular (Tuesday) night that is relatively quiet with not many tables dining at 9.30pm. There are also too many junior waiters that are clearly not well trained to serve in a fine dining setting. The restaurant ambience was just OK, with some loud music coming from Marini’s 57 pub/lounge.

"Philipjan888Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Cosy, quiet place for a relaxing Sunday Italian lunch - a hidden gem indeed!","The 5 of us wanted to go somewhere quiet and romantic with a view for a relaxing Sunday Italian lunch and finally settled for Strato. One of the guys was going to propose to his girlfriend and this place was just the perfect place with lots of privacy and hardly any other guests around that day. It is part of a group of restaurants at the 24th floor of Binjai that has nice views of the KLCC and the surrounding skyline. There were only two other tables with guests and they left early, leaving the whole restaurant to ourselves halfway through our main courses.For starters, we ordered the mixed Italian platter, a mozarella with tomato salad, and a green salad with anchovy dressing so that everyone could share and sample the various dishes. They were all freshly prepared and tasted really good; we were definitely not disappointed and enjoyed that together with the warm, fresh bread.For the mains, we tried the lamb shank, pastas, and the pan-fried chicken. I really enjoyed my spicy black spaghetti with crab meat. Again, they were very nicely done and we were all pleased with our food. To accompany the meal, we selected a bottle of Australian Shiraz which was the perfect complement.We hardly had any more room for desserts and decided to order only two - the panna cotta and the chocolate dessert - to be shared between us. But we did not end our meal until we've had our double expresso complemented by a shot of Grappa!Overall, the food and the staff service were excellent. We were given much attention by the waiters as we were the only ones there most of that Sunday afternoon. The price wasn't cheap but neither was it too expensive for a really decent Italian fine dining meal inclusive of the bottle of wine. Definitely will go again!The building also has plenty of parking space in the basement especially on a Sunday afternoon.",4,2019-08-03,Strato at Troika Sky Dining

Nothing beats a genuinely happy and chirpy happy to see you server attending our table. Dislikes1. Parking (Bangsar generally) can be a pain on weekends. Suggest to start dinners earlier before the crowds and cars come in. 2. We chose to sit outdoor because the evenings were pleasant but the crow problem in Bangsar causes quite a din.

"CrystalismKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Great but be prepared to be slaughtered (very overpriced food),"Great breakfast spot in KL area. Day eats:Many choices to pick from, pork noodles, char kueh teow, chicken rice, roast pork rice, etc. The famous Imbi Pork Noodles can be found here. Pork noodles are however so so overrated thats why they increase the price. Possibly one of the most expensive pork noodle in the area.Night eats:It becomes a tai chow at night, you can practically get all types of fried rice, noodles and dishes. They are famous for the Hokkien Mee, Wat Tan Hor, Cantonese Fried Noodles and such.Regardless of the price, there is still a regular crowd during peak hours.",4,2016-05-24,Restaurant Win Heng Seng
"V00DooKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Not a cheap restaurant,"My friend was craving crabs so I made a dinner reservation for 3 persons and specifically requested to reserve two large crabs for my table. However, when we arrived, we were told that they had no stock of their usual Indonesian mud crabs but had ""french bread crabs"" from Europe (more expensive, of course)! Quite disappointed that the person who took my reservation didn't bother to mention this when I called less than 5 hours earlier!So we ordered 1.5+kg crab for the 3 of us, their house special tofu dish and the ""green dragon vegetable"" dish with macadamias. The tofu and vegetable dishes were really good, and the chili crab very tasty, however, the amount of meat from that large crab was very disappointing. All shell and very little meat!!Our very simple dinner for 3 persons came up to RM278... and we were still hungry so had durians (just down the road) for dessert!",4,2018-07-08,Restoran Green View

meamesKuala Lumpur,Great food and service!,"Heard it's highly recommended to make a table reservation for dinner during the weekend to avoid long wait at the door. I did just that, for my first visit: I called at 12.05pm on 8/8 to reserve a table for 2 at 7pm on the same night. Reservation was fuss free and pleasant. My partner and I arrived at the restaurant exactly at 7pm, saw many people waiting at the door. Gave my name to the friendly staff, and we were led to our table in no time. We had some beers and cocktails while waiting for the food. They arrived quickly, and the food didn't take too long either. We're both small eaters so we shared a plate of stuffed button mushrooms and half slub of BBQ baby back ribs. Both were very delicious. Our small plates were changed after we finished the appertiser and the food presentation was a plus point Portions were normal, so I'd not recommend normal eaters to share food here. My second drink was a half pint of hoegaarden. I saw the server approaching our table with it when a man (I think the manager) called upon her, asking why the glass wasn't full and told her to get it filled to the top. The server did as instructed and soon I got my beer, which was chilled and filled to the max. The place was very busy so it was very pleasant to see that the staff were friendly and alert to our needs. I plan to return to this place, and try other items on the menu. I hope this place will keep up the good job!",5,2015-08-09,Dave's Bistro Bar & Grill

Upon arrival when we asked for table, she didnt even bother to turn to check whether there were available seats and immediately dismissed us saying there are no seats available, when clearly we saw several empty tables. Only when we told her that we see there are a few tables empty that she turned to glance to see the vacant tables and obliged us with a table. Dont know whether its plain laziness or just biasness but whatever the reason, it is an appalling behaviour for a person who is supposed to be the welcoming face of the restaurant.

However, the view is blocked and we can’t see much. The dining area is in fact kind of tucked into a corner.The food is pretty good though. Had a cured meat plate which was lovely, and a nicely grilled kale paired with a refreshing prosecco. Then moved on to rib eye and a duck drum stick, paired with the house reds. The steak is decent but the duck isn’t much to shout about. The house reds are also not very sophisticated (for fine dining standard). This is a nice above mid-tier restaurant. Definitely not fine dining standard, which suits us actually. ",4,2018-09-18,Strato at Troika Sky Dining

We went because it looked OK and there was an outside table available on what was a busy Sunday evening at the beginning of Chinese New Year. I’m glad we did as the food was very good and reasonably priced.We had honeyed sesame chicken, hokien mee and garlic prawns for MYR63 (less than £12) plus a large Tiger beer at MYR12. I did not notice any disputes with the checks (bill) – ours was both written and till-printed and the prices reflected those on the menu so no room for dispute there.Whether it’s the best in the street I can’t say as I didn’t try any of the others, but it was a good, cheap and tasty meal in a great buzzing environment - in fact, it was one of the best dining evenings we had during our tour of Malaysia.",4,2019-02-18,Sai Woo

"AFAK25Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Good food and quiet environment,"We visited this restaurant for dinner to take advantage of the Gourmet Collection vouchers.There were hardly people in the restaurant when we there. I think there were only 2 tables occupied apart from us. So it was pretty quiet affair. We had 2 different soups, ma po tofu, fried garoupa with mixed vege and yam ring and of course half portion of peking duck! The presentation and serving were part of the fun having a peking duck. Here the chef comes out with a serving trolley and sliced the duck skin while the waiter wrapped the sliced duck skin in pancake before serving them to us. After enjoying the skin with the pancake, the remainder was cooked with fried rice.There was a voucher for free dessert. 1 serving of dessert per main course ordered. Dessert was predetermined and you couldn't choose from the menu. However the dessert, sea coconut in plum juice and other yummy stuff plonked in together, did not disappoint.We spent about RM280 and the voucher shaved 50% of that. It was value for money dinner. In fact I would have gladly paid the full price for the restaurant's food quality and the privacy.",4,2018-07-20,Tao Chinese Cuisine

Poppycat94,Bad experience with staff - beware,"Had a bad experience in this pub. The server kept giving us the wrong order. First we asked for whiskey with ice on the side, he gave us on the rocks. Secondly, we asked for strawberry margarita, he gave us lime. Of which both we let pass as these were minor mistakes, but when we asked for the bill, we saw that instead of Gordon’s dry gin, he put Grey Goose, which was priced a bit more than the gin, so we called his attention to correct the bill. But then he proceeded to try to fool us by saying Gordon’s dry gin and Grey Goose vodka IS THE SAME, he even kept on insisting it was the same until we showed him the menu and pointed at the different spirits. Maybe he thought of us as fools, but luckily we know our spirits. When he realized, he just smiled at us foolishly. We thought he was going to correct the bill but he now gave us a stupid excuse that he can’t change it anymore because apparently we already finished drinking. He was even smug and unapologetic the whole time. By now we realized it wasn’t worth it to argue anymore, as this person doesn’t clearly want to admit his mistake and is just plainly stupid. So we paid for the incorrect bill and moved on. Just be careful if you want to visit this place. Drinks aren’t event that good. Margarita glass wasn’t chilled, and is too sweet almost no alcohol taste. Gin tonic has a lot of ice, and again almost no taste of gin in there. There are a lot of other options in the area, might as well try a different place.",1,2020-02-02,Rock Bottom Changkat

Joe took over his father-in-law's noodle stall some 8 years ago. They , like many others used to operate at the Imbi road market in Kuala Lumpur. Sam Keep noodle stall has been in operation for almost 50 years.

"GoingSoloNepalKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",As good as I remembered – MELT IN YOUR MOUTH ROAST PORK,"I revisited Wong Kee Restaurant after an 8-year break. The place is as I remembered – coffee shop with no air-con, people sitting at tables with no food on it, yet waiting patiently. We arrived just after 12pm, sat down and were totally ignored until the ‘siew yoke’ was ready to be served. Not too sure of the ordering system, we observed what the patrons at 5 other tables were doing and followed suit. We helped ourselves to the complimentary soup from a huge pot at the back of the shop, going back for refills. Boiled with large pork bones, ginger and salted vegetables, it is super tasty. A must try!By 12.30pm, all the tables are filled and a takeaway queue forms. The ‘siew yoke’ is brought out and hung at the counter, alongside strips of 'char siew' (grilled pork) and chicken. The lead waitress goes around the tables taking orders (choice of lean or lean/fat layer). We ordered one serving each of lean and lean/fat layer and one-to-go. The owner, Robert Wong comes out at 12.30pm and starts chopping the slab of meat into serve-size portions. The lead waitress has fantastic memory as she correctly delivers exactly what is ordered to each table, on a first-come-first served basis. This is no mean feat, with chicken rice and char siew (grilled pork) added to the mix. While not bad, these two dishes pale in comparison to the ‘siew yoke’.At RM18 per serving, the ‘siew yoke’ is not cheap. But you are assured of a crispy skin and soft meat that literally melts in your mouth with fat layers rendered to perfection. Even foreigners have heard of Wong Kee and are finding their way there, on their own.Highly recommended for ‘siew yoke’ loversUseful Tips: - easier parking on weekends- go early to avoid disappointment - be very very patient (can be hot)- sells out fast",4,2017-02-07,Wong Kee Hai Lam Chicken Rice & Roast Pork

"Laura TMiddlesbrough, United Kingdom","Delicious satay sticks, fast & friendly service, high touristy prices","We stopped here for lunch after a busy morning touring the Butterfly Park and Bird Park and before heading onto Perdana Botanical Gardens for a wander around the park (all within walking distance). The restaurant is located right next to the Bird Park and accessible from inside the park, but you don't need to visit the park to eat here.We had a delicious lunch here of mixed satay sticks (chicken and beef) with stir-fried vegetables and rice. It is great that in Kuala Lumpur you can buy the satay sticks with the peanut sauce on the side, I have a nut allergy but even I can enjoy the food here :-) although I didn't realise the vegetables are stir-fried in sesame oil so hubby had to eat them all - fellow allergy suffers be warned. We ordered 24 mixed satay sticks (which came with a little salad on the side), vegetable and rice meal, with 4 soft drinks and the total came to 111.80MYR, including the tip that is always included, so just over £25. This is expensive for a meal in Malaysia, but it is a toursity area so to be expected. However note 3 times the price of our meal in Little India the next day!Great air conditioning inside, but also seating outside on the terrace overlooking the bird park and trees. We opted for inside after a morning spent in the sun!The food is super tasty! Delicious food, fast and friendly service and clean toilets.

"AleerakVarsity Lakes, Australia","Great Indian Vegetarian Food, but Check Your Watch","I walked to Bakti Woodlands from Bukit Bintang (a nice 20 minute walk) to see what all the fuss was about. This is a fabulous, cheap Indian vegetarian restaurant. This place was so good that it resulted in repeat visits!The main thing to watch for here is the time. On my first visit I wanted to try the tomato uthappam, but I was 20 minutes too late! The uthappam it is only available between 7:30 - 11:30am and 4:00 - 10:00pm. No worries, I tried the madras thali that was recommended by the waiter, and this starts at 11:30am!The thali was huge and believe it or not is unlimited, but I challenge you to eat the whole plate and need more. Based on a previous review I had to try the paneer butter masala and I loved it! It came with bread and was perfectly spiced for my tastebuds.I returned to once again try the uthappam, but it wasn't really to my liking. It was more like just a pancake with chopped tomatoes in it, but it came with all the delicious sauces. Being my last day (and because I was on time) I also decided to try the onion rawa masala dosa, which came with the same sauces as the uthappam, but I found it much more delicious.There are so many items on the menu that I know I'll be back the next time I am in KL.",4,2015-10-23,Woodlands.my Vegetarian Restaurant

"lbakarKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Amazing Lunch with Great Hospitality,"I don't usually write reviews, but when I do, it's either I am disappointed or extremely amazed by the overall service I have received from the place I have visited. Hands down to the Curate team for the fantastic food. Started with the egg sandwich and curry bun, which was appetizing. This was served with sambal-mayo on the side. We ordered their ultimate signature burger and the locally farmed seabass. I was sceptical at first since the bun used for the burger was not to my liking. It was love at the first bite. Changed my mind entirely! It is full of flavour, and everything was perfectly balanced, the patty was juicy; medium-done just how I requested. Drooling continues with the crispy skin seabass with airy lemon foam at the side and black olive tapenade on top. How do you keep a crispy-skin seabass with luscious and tender in the inside? I love it! Wrapping it with pineapple semi freddo ice cream. The ice cream came with a twist of grilled pineapple on top and caramel sauce that was made from the trigona honey. I am not sharing for sure! To top this incredibly mouthwatering dishes, of course, the hospitality by the Curate team. Biggest thank you and applause to Saiful and Sous Chef Moustafa for their hospitality and for Sous Chef for making sure that our food was great and telling us stories about Arab food.

Also, they tends to recommend dishes that are costly to tourist. For a local, we know what to order with a reasonable price. They tends to show face when we did not order the 'higher priced' dishes.

Gary B,Vasco's Wonderful Restaurant with Excellent Staff,"Thank you to all of those that work at making the restaurant so wonderful - we have eaten at Vasco's for the last 3 nights whilst stopping at the Hilton Kuala Lumpur. The food and service was really excellent and that was very much down to the staff especially Vicky, Sanjay, Chef Thinesh, Chef Ridwan and could mention many more - they were so obliging when asked to present a cake for my daughters 18th birthday even singing happy birthday. The chef also specially ensured food prepared was gluten free to suit my wife's dietary needs and spent time discussing options with her which was all very much appreciated. Would definitely recommend an evening dining at Vasco's I am sure you would not be disappointed with the vast choice and delicious cuisine available. We will definitely dine here again when we next visit KL. All good and no problem with recommending.

CalebS628KL,"Terrible service, ignorant staff","One of the worst group of staff I have encountered, right from the top to the bottom. Made a reservation for 8pm but I had to ask multiple times and argued to get a table by 8:30pm. The staff told me to wait at the door but didn’t say much. I then proceed to ask him again and he just waved me off. I then ask another staff, and he said our table are still occupied by existing customers as they decided to order dessert and they are taking longer than expected. I then asked to speak to the boss, and I was pretty sure I caught his attention while speaking to his staff, but the boss chose to avoid speaking to me. By 8:30pm, the staff said I can be seated at a little tiny table by the entrance or at the outdoor area, which was not desirable since I didn’t want to wait. Had to go through a massive debate and argument then I finally got a more decent table at the main part of the restaurant. All of these are a result of making a reservation up front and hoping everything will be smooth. So much I had to beg to be placed at a decent area of the restaurant. The highlight of the night of course is, when the boss finally came to speak to me, he told me that it is normal to wait for a table (but 30 minutes???) in restaurants, let alone Marta’s kitchen is a large restaurant therefore it’s perfectly normal. An apology by him was made nevertheless. By then, I gave up trying to speak to him and proceeded to order my food. Lastly, food was decent but not good enough for me to return to this restaurant and go through another “debate” session with the group of staff at the Restaurant.

There was a French lady manning the front of the house and we learnt later from Chef Flo that she is a friend helping him out. She was very friendly and welcoming, such an added nice touch.We had the fish soup again, my husband's favourite as he thinks its one of the best he ever had! We also had the charcuterie board which included two terrines which were really tasty.For mains, he had the pork fillet mignon while I had the weekend special which was a beef tenderloin. The pork was very tasty but the best was my beef. The tenderloin was tender and very juicy and it came with a lovely red wine jus. The menu said 180 gm but I think my cut was bigger than that, which was good.We enjoyed the meal very much, coupled with a bottle of nice red wine. Ambience was pleasant, still not air-conditioned but the many fans and open concept meant it was not stuffy.If you are looking for French food that does not burn a hole in your pocket, then this is the place to go to.

"771gordonmSydney, Australia","Great food, excellent service, all round good experience","This Indian restaurant is located on Lebuh Ampang between Jalan Tun Perak and Jalan Gereja where there are a dozen other Indian restaurants on this 100 metre stretch of road which makes for intense competition where you have to be good to survive. And so it proved that for the Punjabi Thali which I tried for lunch was wonderfully tasty meal. Granted this is not the cheap meals you'd get down in the Brickfields area for under 10RM but my lunch here came with a soup and ice-cream desert and I'd happily paid the extra for excellent attentive service, cold air-cond, and a spotlessly clean eating environment. There are other Indian restaurants to try out in this street but I walked away knowing I'd be back to sample more from the menu.",5,2018-04-10,Sangeetha

"brendas329Cypress, Texas",Loved the Peking Duck and pancakes - yum!,"A friend and colleague who had recently repatriated to Malaysia took me here for dinner when I was there on a business trip. She has many fond memories of going here for special occasions with her family when she was growing up. She ordered Peking Duck for us to split which was served table side with the staff slicing the skin off the duck and then another person putting the skin, sauce, and vegetables into the pancakes and then folding/rolling them. OMG, so good. We both ate a bunch. The rest of the duck meat was cooked with dry noodles. We had way more than we could eat, so my friend took home the leftovers. We also had the Lotus Pancake for dessert. Everything was delicious. Very nice ambience. With 4 alcoholic drinks and 1 softdrink, our total was RM 370 after tax and service charge. This is a bit higher than my other meals in KL, but this was for Peking Duck and it was excellent. Highly recommend!",5,2019-09-16,Shang Palace

noisyminor,"Decent food, cosy setting and reasonable price ","We stayed in Doubltree Hilton for the night thus Intermark was the first choice for dinner. After walking around, we decided to eat at Porto Romano. (We frequented its branch in Mount Kiara often thus roughly knew what to expect.)We arrived early and were the third couple in the restaurant. That was good because we got to choose where we wanted to sit easily. (It was getting a bit more crowded as night went on.)Menu was extensive with all the usual Italian suspects - antipasto, pasta, risotto, tiramisu and whatnots. We decided to try some not-so-usual dishes for an Italian eatery. An Australian grass-fed tenderloins steak with pepper sauce and a braised ox tail dish with saffron rice. Servings weren't too big. Just the right amount for us small eaters. Steak was cooked properly to medium rare, a seem-to-be-difficult-to-achieve-task in Malaysia in general. Thumbs up for that. Ox tails were braised nicely and stewed till to the right tenderness while retaining a bit of bites. The rice was cooked al dente, the true Italian way. Not the typical softer Asian manner. Love.Simple and relatively fast preparation. Service was OK. Again, Porto Romano is a reliable place to go when one doesn't feel like thinking too much about what to eat. ",4,2016-02-27,Porto Romano
"MichelleH4369Auckland, New Zealand",Breaky brunch ,I visited on a busy Saturday morning when the flea market was on Parking as always in KL can be tricky and expensive especially on weekends . We couldn’t make a booking by phone but were able to leave our names when we arrived and so made the most of the time browsing the market for 20 minutes till we got the call. Inside and outside eating spaces and clearly busy seating is comfortable though there is a unique raised area where you can sit in the floor at low tables.The breakfast menu is varied and innovative with big variety and a twist . No simple eggs bene here. Easy to understand and not pretentious in its foodie ness .Good coffee and quick service . Staff noticed we were getting crowded in by a group of overflowing ladies with children and handbags and suggested a quick table exchange. I like this sort of attentiveness to guests . The food was good I had the sweet corn and zucchini fritters with poached eggs and it came with a coleslaw and a number of garnishes including avocado and pea sprouts The fritters were small golden crunchy quenelles and my companions enjoyed the salmon and beef cheek. Definitely a nice way to enjoy a slow start to the day and would be great for lunch. ,4,2018-09-30,Breakfast Thieves

Once I allowed them to serve me and they gave me all the rubbish durian which were like potatoes and laughed in my face and said these are the best.....Best my foot..... I came again with my dog to dapau and they shooed me away...... The dog was tiny and in my arms..... What did they expect would happen? Bite their face off? and they can choose to stand further away if they are unhappy with it without shoo-ing me and giving me a dirty look as I am your customer.

"worldtravler1111Province of Milan, Italy",Quite the Experience!,We had a lovely lunch here during our visit at the Shangri-La KL. Chinese cuisine is not something we typically eat but we thought we should roll the dice and give the restaurant a try since it looked so good. We were very happy we did because it was a fantastic experience. The food was extremely tasty and the portions were big. We were able to share 3 dishes that was more than enough for two people. Amazing tea selection as well. Even if you don't like Chinese food this is well worth a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised!,5,2020-01-09,Shang Palace
DisappointedDude123,Poor service and worst booking system,"Called to book and was told no table hence asked for following date that’s available for reservation. Was given one week in advance for reservation but only bar area was available. Insisted for a table so the only reservation available was 3 weeks in advance. Fast forward on actual day, my wife and I arrived and was told no table for us only bar table. I explained we called and reserve for a table and was assisted by a lady through the phone. I think it’s the manager or someone with management level spoke to me replying me to talk to the lady who spoke to me on the phone. How the heck I suppose to know who the lady was..and he even replied she’s on off day that day. Made a big fuss and totally disappointed.",1,2019-10-27,Mitasu Restaurant

"Kevin BPerth, Australia",Heaven!,"Ahhh….nirvana.Stunning presentation and outstandingly exquisite sashimi from Chef Tadashi Inose.Tatsu is true to Japanese aesthetics where simplicity underscores the complexity of great food. The surroundings are clean and modern, a fusion of contemporary minimalism and modernism that flows effortlessly across the sushi bar, teppanyaki counter, the main dining room and the lounge bar. There are also four private dining rooms for executive meetings or special occasions.I loved the little touches: the ice mould; the “hit me” chocolate which you literally have to mash and mangle before eating.Thank god I didn’t tuck into the sake and wine, because this is a connoisseur’s paradise surrounded by floor to ceiling glass windows. The views are stunning. You can ogle at the cascading waterfall and perfectly manicured gardens whilst sampling any of the 20 types of sake, as well as Shochu and wines.If you're a sushi or sashimi fan, this is where you need to go!",5,2017-03-25,Tatsu Japanese Cuisine

Waiting times depend how far below you are on the cashier's queue list, which is based on the number of people you are with. We waited...40 minutes? Upon the availability of a table with your pax, your name will be called and you can then proceed to ordering their favourites - pork chop, roti babi and roast pork with wedges. Our order arrived within 5 minutes and to my pleasant surprise, the meals were not as oily as they were four years ago. They were just as tasty as they were supposed to be, albeit less oily.Toilets and overall ambience is quite clean, but you are expected to leave the moment you finish your meals. Do not hog the seats!",4,2017-12-10,Yut Kee

"gklingeniumKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Let down by the manager,"Good restaurants alas go into decline and then collapse, and add to the changing pattern of restaurants in places like Sri Hartamas. It may well be that the Malabar Palace has started on that downward course.I have been a regular customer at the restaurant since it opened some years ago. The food is very good and good value for money, especially at lunchtime, and the service is up to the high standards one can expect in Malaysia. The restaurant has even recently moved to a more attractive location in the shopping centre. The quality of management has gone up and down, and just very occasionally, standards have slipped. The few people who have given the restaurant a low rating must have been unusually unfortunate, or else they just don't like this kind of Indian food.I certainly wasn't expecting what happened at lunchtime just a few days ago. My wife was about to chair an important meeting, and so we were in a hurry. We sat waiting, but despite several reminders, our lunch did not arrive. After half an hour or so, it was obvious that the waiters knew that something was wrong, and so I went to talk to the man on the till, who I took to be the manager. As a regular customer, I wanted to know what the problem was, but instead of acknowledging that there was indeed a problem and apologising for the delay, he tried to pretend that all was well and that there was no problem at all. This put me in the position as though I were making an unreasonable complaint. Not being blessed with logical reasoning, he even insisted that it took up to 15 minutes to prepare a lunch, as though 15 minutes was rather longer than half an hour.When the manager insults regular customers, and talks nonsense that the customer knows to be untrue, you know that a restaurant has problems rather bigger than delayed lunches. I want a formal apology from the Malabar Palace, and I want a full explanation from the man on the till to explain his inappropriate behaviour.",3,2018-01-26,Malabar Palace Sri Hartamas

Certain areas could be improved to give this location what it deserves Pros- Views and music 10/10, unbelievable to see the fireworks and city from here with a good party atmosphere- Food was good, perhaps not outstanding but definitely a good standard.- Staff all extremely welcoming and friendly- after the food, we were well looked after with our own standing table to continue the celebrations Cons- service was slow at times, and two of our waiters were getting confused bringing our starters twice, and asking us to pay twice, but no real issues here.- once the restaurant turned into the bar, the service became terrible. It took very long to get drinks, and the cocktails we had were almost undrinkable (spicy mojito with a whole chilli in?! And a VERY salty margarita). This left us with only options of wine or champagne, which didn’t even come with an ice bucket until we asked!Overall the setting, views and music really made this place, let down mainly by the drinks and slow service. I would accept this usually on NYE, but it wasn’t overly busy and the staff should be able to cope. If these parts are improved it could easily be a 5/5. ",4,2020-01-01,Fuego at Troika Sky Dining

I particularly like the pomelo salad and lemongrass chicken.I needed a restaurant to provide home catering for a dinner party of about 20 people in the Christmas-New Year week. Ekkamai accommodated my requests for adjustments to some dishes. Set-up was smooth and done in good time - and clearing up after was efficient and discreet.

Although i requested medium. The fries is cold, the seafood soup is extremely salty with unfresh prawns. Total bill cost RM230+ for 2. Not worth the price at all. During booking requested sitting at the window but they restricted. Only spending RM250 and above can allow sitting at the window. Ridiculous.. Rm250 can enjoy better food at other restaurants.

"gaik1518Chieri, Italy",Horrible Japanese Buffet,"We went there for buffet dinner during New Year's Day. There were 12 adults, and 1 kid. This restaurant serves ala carte dishes for its buffet.The restaurant was full house when we arrived, luckily we made reservation 1 day earlier and was placed in a separate room.We ordered almost everything on the menu. But garlic fried rice only arrived at our table after 2 hours, we reminded the kitchen few times but that order only came to us when we were done with our dessert ice cream.We ordered hot green tea, but was unserved and end up we need to get ourselves the cold version of it.Overall, all the food was fresh, especially for fresh oysters and shasimi.We ordered salmon shasimi, was disappointed when we saw the dish was served with its dark color fresh and the cut was not perfect as there were a few pieces sticking together when we pick up one piece to eat. It was fresh, but the texture is not good, the shasimi quality was disappointing.The cooked dishes were too salty for our taste. And all of us can't even swallow the beef cube dish (can't remember the name of the dish) that we ordered. The beef cube was cooked, but it has powdery texture when it was bitten, all of us puke it away as the taste was disgusting and not palatable.The seasoned baby octopus taste good, except it was still icy cold when it was served, and the ice melted in my mouth when I first bite it.At the end of the session, all of us reached consensus that we should never come for its buffet meal again.",1,2015-01-07,Mitasu Restaurant

We know it’s not easy to get it evenly cooked but it was PERFECTLY PERFECTLY roasted. 110%. The charring and caramelising on the outside was absolutely spot on. The red in the meat was uniform without any overcooking or raw parts. The server took time to explain in detail how it was prepared and even how to enjoy it best. Excellent sides of mashed potatoes, garlic rice, sauerkraut and coleslaw. There’s nothing here that’s not good and we had little to complain about. Superb cheese ring sausage, pancetta and ox tongue.

"Irene SKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A place for the service not food!,"Highly recommended by my friend and I decided to drop by to the nearby outlet instead of the recommended Subang outlet. Honestly, being a Mexican cuisine fans, the menu is real tempting where you just want to try everything . Generally, the food is not tasty as expected. It was a big disappointment despite I have not tried Subang's and there's nothing to be in comparison of. The full slab lamb rack at RM26 per piece is the worst not value for money. It's rather mild and I couldn't take it after the bite.The service level by the crew members are excellent and I certainly can't deny it any further.

The staff were very attentive and concerned about my comments, however I doubt if anything will be done about serving real chips with the fish. If you are a non smoker, the other drawback with the restaurant is that you have to go through a cloud of awful cigarette smoke to get to your table. Not pleasant.

But I suppose that’s what you get when big cuts of steak is cooked alacarte. Wood fire cooking is just a fantasy. The cauliflower panna cotta was a joke. Sides were small and pathetic for a concept that should be focused on meal-sharing. RM20 for portabello and you only get one and a half piece. Yeah, it was halved. How desperate can a restaurant be?

"MaithengKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Lisette is disappointing,"I went there in June last year and wrote a great review. I had their buffet and it was truly fabulous. I went there today and what a disappointment. I ordered a quiche that was served in its aluminium cover and not very tasty either.... heated up in microwave! And a kale salad with really very little kale and a mayonnaise on the side HUH??? My dressing was definitely not an anchovy dressing and that was RM22 for the salad  Moreover I had to wait a really long time to get my salad and by the time it came, everyone was finished with their food! It looked dry and below average. They have extended they place so it does not look as nice as it did n the past and i think they are cutting down on all the ingredients when it comes to food. Not sure I want to go back! Can't recommend this place anymore. Bad service. Poor food. My cost RM40 ",2,2020-03-04,Lisette's Café & Bakery Bangsar

I always believe a true chef narrates in his food, you know from the first bite that you're in the presence of an artist. Every single ingredient makes perfect sense for one another , together they take you and your palate on a fantastic journey. IMHO DC tops my list of 3 places in KL that have perfected the art of fusion cuisine without being gimmicky or pretentious, synergies the best of contrasting cultures. This is a place where one could savour premium seasonal produce with solid skills and mad talents. Service is also one of the best, knowledge staff who are personal but not intrusive. What you get is a humble, understated team that stays true to their passion. DC is one place that makes Malaysia proud and i look forward to more exciting development for them.

"JustinChan1996Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Reasonably priced sushi Sets with Premium ingredients!!!,"I visited Hanaya the second time to try out their lunch sushi set ""Matsu"" and I was glad that it exceeded my expectations that for 100 ringgit, I can savour premium ingredients such as tuna belly and sea urchin which can only be found in more expansive sets. Thus, this makes it one of the most value for money premium sushi set in any restaurants in KL.The ingredient list of the sushis are as follow(in order):Alfoniso (Kimedai)Amberjack (Kanpachi)GrouperKinfejaw (Ishigaki)Hokkigai clam (raw surf clam)Akami tunaSea urchin from HokkaidoSquid with shrimp pasteOotoro tuna(tuna belly)Negi Toro and Kappa rollTalking about the sushi, the sushi neta(toppings) are well seasoned to complement its taste of the fish itself but I do find the topping portion to be too big compared to rice portion. This means that when I will be still chewing the topping after I finish chewing all the rice. A balanced portion of topping and rice will work out better in that case.Regarding the service, it would be better if there is better communication between the server staff and the sushi chef as the appetizers after the first few sushis which should not happen at all. Other than that, the quality of service still holds well since the last time I visited there.",4,2015-11-05,HANAYA Japanese Dining
"CrystalismKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Horrible salty noodles, raw veggie, too much MSG soup","I bet you've seen this famous Soong Kee noodles in some random foodcourt. It became so famous that they have branches all over Klang Valley now. Decided to pay a visit to the original shop and it was a complete letdown. Noodles were not properly done (you know it's slightly raw when it's not really cooked), too much oil, and boy, those bitter veggie. Urgh. No more next time. The beef balls were rather normal, like the ones you can get in the market. Soup is so bland, full of MSG flavours only. Noodle only rely on soy sauce, pretty much just salty and kicap taste, nothing else. What is there to shout about? I'd rather go for Ngau Kee Beef Noodles. I'm actually disappointed because I thought the original shop would maintain some sort of standards. In fact, I wasn't the only one who felt the same way. Shouldn't they consider increasing their QC or train their staffs before serving to customers?! Though, if you're after something quick, this would do justice. Food were all served in less than 5 minutes even before the drinks arrived. Call me bias but they kept switching people to prepare the noodles so it because so inconsistent. Our noodles were prepared by foreign workers while the old Chinese uncle was having his lunch. Thus, quality is probably lousier having even simply thing like veggie being uncooked. I'm surprised this place lasted until today.",1,2016-01-12,Restoran Soong Kee

yeancek,Excellent MO Sandwich!,"I have written s short review on MO Bar as an integral part of my MO KL review. If anyone interested in it, one can find the link at the end of this review.I am impressed by MO KL Bar. It has an open space concept, and yet doesn't loose the sense of intimacy and privacy, thanks to the clever use of the rounded bar in the centre. I was sitting at the back of the bar. A very polite and gentle waitress came to serve. I chose the MO Sandwich... and never regretted it. while waiting for the order, I needed some extra service. So, I attracted the attention of a passing-by waitress. Well... it suffices to say that the initial impression I received was not great.I mentioned this in my previous MO KL review. Shortly after, the manager of MO KL wrote to me, apologising for what has happened. So, in conclusion, I must admit the the management is serious in offering the best service possible to clients, which is laudable.So. For those who feel peckish, wanting to have a bit of a nibble, I recommend the delicious MO Sandwich!My previous review on MO KLhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g298570-d301416-r572774044-Mandarin_Oriental_Kuala_Lumpur-Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html",5,2018-04-20,"MO Bar at Mandarin Oriental, Kuala Lumpur"
"WanikCopenhagen, Denmark",THE Italian restaurant to go with the Family in KL,"Having been nearly 3 years now in Kuala Lumpur, we only heard about Tatto recently through friends's friend. We went there twice during the last 10 days during Xmas break and we have to admit that we found a new ""best place to go "" in KL. The reason why I say this is because it is true Italian food: home made pasta and pizza, real ""veal"" milanese etc. Portion are perfect size (home made dessert are crazy good) and the price are VERY fair. Bottom line, finding an Italian restaurant for the family (5 of us including 3 kids) has always been an issue in KL in our eyes and we have clearly found it. The (important) cherry on the cake is the service: consistent, super welcoming and professional which is not a given in KL. ",5,2014-12-29,Tatto

Place is quite dated to suggest the premium we were paying.Service was also below the mark as the foreign waiter didn't understand what we were asking. Female cashier insisted on playing the music loudly to her choice. Hardly makes conversations possible without speaking loudly as well. She also ignored our request to snap our group photo! To top it all they didn't accept credit cards for payment. You need to bring your own sachet of patience with you to enjoy the place!

Irina FFlorida,Can't wait for my free cocktail ,"We decided to look on Trip Advisor for a restaurant nearby the One World Hotel and we found this one that had very good reviews and was top top-five. We get to concierge to ask about reservations and he said we could walk in---sure enough we were super excited to find out that there was a table open once we arrived at 6 PM the time of opening for the restaurant. We got a great table with a view of the city however, the weather did not hold up and we weren't able to see that gorgeous skyline and the sunset that would've been. For starters, we ordered the duck wraps, however the duck meat was not warm and the wraps were way too toasted. For a main course my friend and I decided to share the lamb shank which was a perfect portion for two. The lamb was extremely savory and tender which is a high-grade coming from an Australian friend. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake -it was marvelous! On the menu it doesn't say spicy, but once the waiter brought it out, he announced it as the spicy chocolate cake. Ps. The lava cake took 20 minutes to arrive just FYI. Overall, great dinner for our last night in Kuala Lumpur. ",4,2017-02-28,Signature by the Hill @ The Roof

This was not easy as the tempo was toooo high and the waiters didnt have time to listen to the orders.Nonetheless, the food was remarkably good, a real culinary experience, and i will definitely come again.

Mitchell_Lim,Deli-cious!,"I've got a little mixed review but overall experience was still pretty good!Having lived in the UK for many years, deli/butcher-styled joint is rather close to my heart.The most applaudable element for this restaurant is the freshness of its sausages & meat. Not easy to find in KL/PJ.  Plenty of varieties to choose from & I'd say, it takes at least 3 visits to sample all they have to offer.Sausages (various)• Freshness: 10/10• Authenticity: 4/10• Overall flavour: 7/10• Seasoning: Level of salt needs to be reduced by at least 30% across the boardMarinated cut (i.e. Pork belly)• Freahness: 10/10• Overall flavour: 9/10• Seasoning: Level of salt needs to be reduced by at least 20% across the board• Dipping sauce: Very tasty brown sauce but the overpowering white pepper sauce drowns every flavour any meat has to offer.Salad• Freshness: 10/10• Dressing: Honey balsamic vinegrette 3/10• Seasoning: Under seasoned, poor oil:acid:sweetness ratio & poorly executed emulsification.Jacket potato• Freshness: 8/10• Topping: Bacon wasn't crispy, sour cream lack acid & tartness, missing herb butter to perfume & under seasoned.Big thumbs up they serve grained mustard as opposed to American mustard Generally, service was quite quick once seated & order placed. Waiters asked whether ice was required with bottled drinks, opening & pouring them & checking whether one prefers to drink beer directly from bottle or glass. Great effort!The bit on poor experience (while making payment)...was how the lady boss displayed lack of tact & poor attitude in responding to a staff's enquiry. Undesirable employee experience that translated into uneasy feeling for customers.",4,2017-10-06,Anne Elizabeth The Deli Restaurant

"SphingxKuala Lumpur, Malaysia","A lot of style, but very little substance. Left the place hungry.","Several people raved about this place. After going there, I do not understand why.The pros:The service from the waiter is some of the best I've ever encountered in a KL restaurant, even in some of the top hotels. It's friendly, attentive, non-snobbish. Downright fantastic.The cons:The food. Don't get me wrong. The food is not bad. It's not fantastic either, it's just kind of slightly above average with a lot of frills to shill it as something extraordinary. They have a very fancy menu with reams of superlative information describing the food. Did you know that you can make any food sound fancy by adding the place of origin before the item itself? For example (this is not the exact item on the menu, just a demonstration of the style): Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops in Irish cream sauce, or Australian fillet mignion, served with Chilean asparagus or Tuscan rabbit or something (yes that was sarcasm). All these only serve to make the food sound more impressive than it is. There is even this really expensive dessert called 'And Ode to Newton' which has its own special card describing how it's anti-gravity and avant garde and all that, but basically is a scoop of ice cream on a wafer of flavoured ice on a glass of ginger beer. All for the bargain price of RM 25+This would not be such a bad thing if the portions were so minuscule for how much they charge you (RM 50-80 for a main). You order saddle of rabbit and you get one tiny little piece barely bigger a 50 sen coin. The duck breast was supposedly served with mash but what you actually get is a little dollop that looks like it had been served with a teaspoon.I don't mind paying for quality, but when a place is hyped but turns out to be so much style, and so little substance, it's really underwhelming. And honestly, if you paid 1k for one meal for a party of 5, I would have expected everyone NOT to leave the place hungry. The only way I'd ever recommend this restaurant to anyone if they and their wallet want a bit of weight loss, and if you enjoy the ambience and the prestige of having that kind of money to burn, I suppose.",3,2014-12-07,Bistro a Table

It's a Sunday and we took the MRT instead... no problem. Place is relatively clean and service is pretty fast. Ordered free range chicken and we're not disappointed as the texture and bite size portion is chewy and pleasant. Gizzard and liver was also commendable. Char Siew & Siew Yoke was only so so. The oyster sauce lettuce & choy sum were surprising refreshing and crunchy. Their winning secret: chili sauce was not as good as I remembered but still suffice.

Farah S,Another memorable anniversary dinner!,"Hubs surprised me, again, for our anniversary dinner at this treasure restaurant that we very much liked. And again, they still managed to astound me.For starters, hubs ordered the truffled prawn(again cz it ws so good the last time) and it tasted just as it did before. The combination of fried prawns, truffle cream, honey and crushed nuts was praised by him from the start of our dinner til the end. Which by the way, interrupted my moment with Cafe Cafe's delicate foie gras. The texture was just right with apple compote and pears. However, the apple vinaigrette overpowered the dish a bit.For our mains, hubs had the lamb medallion. The honey lemon mustard dressing complemented the portioned medallion. He very much enjoyed the sauce and surprisingly finished his quinoas and lentils salad. I had the beef tenderloin and it was perfectly cooked as per requested(I love when people get my steak right). The meat was tender and well seasoned. The wasabi dressing was a bit much for me, I finished hubs dressing instead (wife material lol).To end, hubs ordered his all-time-fav, the creme brulee. Yeap, he did the trick(refer to my previous review on Cafe Cafe) again and our waiter seemed to be proud of the fact that he taught us that on our previous visit. He should be cuz we do that trick EVERYWHERE for our creme brulee. I had their chocolate cake and the center was heavenly molten. Taste wise, it was average but still good to have it once in a while.All and all, our visit at Cafe Cafe was amazing(again). Thanks for the decoration for our anniversary and thanks for the helpful waiters! ",4,2017-08-17,Cafe Cafe

Food was good though. Finally the bill came and guess what, they overcharged us and the waiter had the gut to tell us that he cannot reprint the receipt with correct amount.

The banana leaf option comes with a few toppings and then you can choose the meat you want on it. We also ordered the iced pulled tea, which was absolutely delicious, we in fact ordered 3 each! After the meal we were so stuffed that we couldn't get up for 30 minutes. So we stayed there and enjoyed the local vibe and talked through the day.

Par performance this time","Ate the BBQ full Rack of ribs, Caesar salad and the dirty nachos..total of the bill was rm191...with advent of the gst on top of the 10% service charge eating out in Malaysia has become markedly even more expensive..therefore in order to justify the increase in prices, proprietors should increase the quality and attention to detail. Unfortunately the reverse seems to be the case..the usually stellar ribs seem to be an after thought these days in light of the burgeoning business and the expansion to bangsar...the ribs which are normally rather flavorful now seem to lack seasoning and were stringy, which I believe were the result of not being cooked long enough before being thrown on the grill.

I find their environment likeable but some people may find that the tables are very closely arranged. However, with floor-to-ceiling views of KL city, everything else matters little.

"MXH15Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Carnivorous carnival for kings!,"Skip lunch, have a fruit for tea and go crazy at dinner with Carnaval. It's all the meat you can eat, brought to your table by the passadors, or servers. There are two options to choose from: light meal and full meal. Save up and go for the full meal. You will be served an assortment of meats and dishes: beef brisket, lamb shoulder, chicken ham, glazed pineapple, grilled fish, chicken drumsticks, sausages, garlic beef, garlic bread. My suggestion, take one slice at a time, if you like a certain meat, ask for extras the next round. Just like any other buffet, form a strategy. Skip the carbs at the salad / rice / pasta bar. Attack the greens to balance off the red meat. Eat slow so that your body can digest better and allow more intake later. And have hot tea or hot water to ease digestion. You don't want to feel bloated midway through dinner. Have the pineapples with the chicken ham and other meats if you wish, I find that it helps with digestion too. Perhaps the enzyme at work? If you prefer your meat to be more cooked, you can request the passadors to 'fire it up' for you. Best to go with company as you can share slices of meat if it becomes too much for you. For a full meal, be prepared to pay RM92 per pax inclusive of GST. Be prepared to hear lots of moans and groans as teeth around you sink into succulent and full-flavoured meats.

"thefoodwizardKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",A brilliant addition to KL’s culinary scene,"The visit to this restaurant was completely spontaneous and I guess the best experiences in life are usually unplanned. Entier has truly superseded my expectations. I’ve not been this excited over a fine dining establishment in this country since Dewakan. To begin with, I am not sure if I should classify Entier as a fine dining restaurant. The interior and the quality of the food are definitely upscale, but it doesn’t have that uppity snootiness commonly prevalent in restaurants of the same class where the stiff attitude is often more starched than the table cloths. The prices are very reasonable too considering the high level of sophistication in the food.Finding our way there was an adventure in itself. Although visible with the naked eye from afar, the tall black concrete erection known as Alila Hotel that has recently protruded into the Brickfields skyline, required some back alley exploration. Innuendoes aside, the real stimulation of senses took place on the plates of this swanky restaurant that shares the 41st floor with the hotel lobby.The ambience has an understated modern vibe to it that feels warm and inviting despite the clean, minimalist interior and monochromatic shades of nudes and whites. Let’s just say that it wouldn’t look out of place at all in the Monocle dining guide. The coveted seats are definitely the booths by the window, which afford diners unobstructed views of the city.Ordering is made easy with the smartly designed menu. Just think about what you want to eat first - beef, chicken, lamb, seafood, vegetables? And the well curated pages will guide you through the options based on the food you feel like having rather than on the conventional appetiser, main or dessert categories.The first dish that arrived was a vegan work of art that came straight from the Josper oven. The ash-free, pure charcoal heat of the grill-oven infused the tender Australian eggplant with a clean, smokey flavour. The pistachio dukkhah and sesame seeds gave it texture, whilst the saikyo miso cream added umami notes to the dish. A lot of thought went into what could have been just grilled eggplant.The chicken wing balls came shortly. It reminded me of Chinese Boxing Chicken where part of the flesh is stripped off, exposing the bone like a lollipop stick. This version is more like a minced meat ball, coated with crumbs, and served with Basquiase capsicum sauce. In retrospect, I am beginning to wonder if what I thought were paper-thin crisps of cheese in the dish were actually chicken skin crisps! Hmm... interesting.The seafood and beef dishes arrived together and what a pretty sight they were. Loved the sous vide Spanish Mackerel served with delicious lobster bisque, lily bulbs, bamboo clams and red spinach. I thought the inclusion of chilli oil gave the dish an added dimension of flavours and a local twist that reminded me of prawn mee.The Braised Australian Short Ribs was a paleo indulgence with a contemporary spin. The meat was literally fall-of-the-bone tender, the pea purée was smooth and creamy, and the hazelnut crust added a welcoming crunch to the meat. Pomegranate seems to be the in-thing these days but I am glad it had a real purpose in this dish; it provided that hint of acidity which helped balance the richness of the meat.I was already pretty full after all these courses. But it was hard to resist ordering the 70% single-origin Pahang dark chocolate soufflé. My only regret having this luscious, decadent dessert was the struggle to finish it. The size was clearly not for those who wanted something light.It was only after the meal that I read the restaurant’s philosophy in the menu booklet. Entier means ‘entire’, which explains its nose-to-tail concept of utilising every part of an ingredient to minimise wastage. I did wish this concept was more evident in every dish though, rather than just through the inclusion of offal dishes which I did not order.I also found out later that the talented chef Masashi Horiuchi was formerly the sous chef at L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon in London - that probably has some influence on the spirit of conviviality in this restaurant, despite its upmarket appearance. All that aside, I think what’s most important is that the food delivered. I had a most scrumptious, hearty meal and I am definitely bookmarking this restaurant as one of my favourites.",4,2018-09-13,Entier French Dining

KatyDaisy,Place is certainly cute. ,Place is certainly cute but food was really average. Maybe I dislike the cilantro in the cheese and egg and mushroom croissant. Ambience is certainly enjoyable and staffs are nice. Also not super expensive.,3,2020-09-19,Leaf & Co Cafe
mia7jane,Healthier than fast food,More than rm20 for each burger. Worth trying but can't afford it everyday. They use fresh chicken breast meat for burger which is healthier than those fast food restaurant.,3,2016-12-30,myBurgerLab
"WongHY17Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Egg... not Eggs,"I have visited all 4 La Bodega outlets, Pavilion being the latest.Ordered the Egg Florentine and Pan Con Tomate.Florentine - Expected to have 2 eggs, but instead it had only 1.I reread the menu, and then I realized it...The menu did really mention only ONE egg.Guess the menu can be quite confusing, because the Eggs Benedict has 2 eggs, and both Florentine and Benedict are the SAME price.Pan Con Tomate - 4 slices of toast with grated tomato and cecina (spanish air-dried beef).My first time tasting cecina beef. Salty and flavorful, it is like a tapas. Below is my personal order of ranking for all 4 La Bodega outlets:1) Empire Subang - Better food.2) Bangsar Shopping - Comfortable and cool outdoor seating. Good service.3) Bangsar Telawi - Versatile, as you can choose to dine either in the deli, restaurant, or lounge.4) Pavilion - More expensive than the 3 other outlets, and service felt rushed.However, I guess no more return for me since La Bodega increased their prices starting 1 June 2018.",3,2018-07-01,La Bodega Pavilion KL
"FFadnanKuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Cozy and good food,"Located on 6th floor of Pavilion, this place is suitable for relaxing after works. It has Malaysian menu as well as international and also fusion. Grill chicken with honey & thyme (i dont know its their portion or what but my chicken is way too small but the taste is good!), Chicken Satay, Beef Rendang is a must try. For dessert, try their Pavlova. One of the best in KL.",4,2018-02-26,Serai Pavilion KL
chiaras719,Decent,"It was okay, not great tho. The quality of the food is low compared to the price, you can definitely find better cheaper restaurants in the area. The staff is friendly and the place clean.",3,2017-12-10,Pinchos Tapas Bar
