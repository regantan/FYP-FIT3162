{"text": "Being an indian in Malaysia, I grew up eating a variety of Indian food and my partner is from India and knows his lentils, curries and indian breads well. However, we like to try Oriental, Western and Mediterranean food when we go out. But on some rare occasions, we would go back to the roots and try a good Indian restaurant, although we choose our 'place-to-eat' carefully :)This past weekend we were craving Indian food. So after a bit of research we decided to try a small cafe in Bangsar called 'Ganga Cafe'. I was not expecting myself to be awed by the food but that changed the moment we tried the appetizer 'Samosa Chaat'. The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy and the crispy samosa chunks was heavenly.My partner had the Channa Bhatura and it was crispy with a tender texture with chana rightly spiced for our palate. I ordered the Parantha with Palak Paneer (Cheese Spinach) and I enjoyed every bite of my tongue tantalizing food. But the best part of our order was this amazing drink called Pranic Juice which just leaves you refreshed and awake after every sip. It is a mixture of mint, lemon and few other ingredients..Bottomline, if you like vegetarian Indian food you should definitely check this place out. It is delicious and value for money too.

We were greeted professionally by the staff and they all seemed to be fairly knowledgeable on what they offer. We had the 5 course menu and I would rank the appetizers and pre-main to be above their main course. My selection for main course was the steak. Hence comparing to other restaurants which predominantly specialize in their meat, DC would come short on that dish. Apart from that, the rest were great. However, one thing worth to mention is the attitude of one particular staff at the restaurant. We ordered a 2012 wine but when the wine arrived it was a 2014. I assumed that they brought the right wine and hence I did not particular note the year stated on the bottle. It was after a glass which I finally picked up the bottle and started looking at it closely. Only to realize they had serve me a 2014 bottle. When I questioned the staff, he said that they have ran out of the 2014. When I asked him why didn't anyone from the floor informed us, he replied me by saying sorry that they forgot to inform us.

I mentioned that maybe it would be nice to tell the customers beforehand that a dish is not available, or maybe even mention it on the menu, there's an idea, if it's never available for lunch. Not much reaction, the guy takes the menu away without asking me what else I would like as a main course. I decide to let it go and see if anyone notices there is no second main course ordered. I have to mention that we are the only customers at 12.45 on a Saturday. Pat\u00e9 arrives, ok, nicely presented, average taste, and so does my scallop and crab salad a bit later. I start eating it and just cannot find any trace of scallops. I mention it to the waiter, who laughs, goes to the kitchen and comes back to say \"no scallops so we put extra crab meat\". Not the salad we ordered (and of course no mention of the change to the customer), no main course ordered, the Danish chef witnesses the whole scene and does not make a move to explain, let alone apologize. We decide to walk out, ask for the bill for food and drink consumed (it does come with no argument) and as we go out, we mention our discontent to the chef. His only reply (he is very shy or he really really doesn't care) is, we've not had scallops for 2 months... WHY NOT TELL THE CUSTOMER OR TAKE THE DISH OFF THE MENU ??? We told him that we understand that in Malaysia things don't always come out as they should, but a simple explanation or apology would have made things better when there are such blunders. Even better, get organised and tell the customers what they are going to get (or cannot get) before the order is taken... we really felt he couldn't care less... shame as this was a promising restaurant but we will never set foot in the place again. I can understand this level of service in a cheap eatery, but from a restaurant that considers itself trendy and upmarket, it is more than puzzling. And they do look like they need customers, only two more had arrived when we left at 1.15pm. Others restaurants in the area were packed and we had a lovely lunch with excellent service at Ashley's by Living Foods just up the road.", "labels": [{"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}]}

{"text": "Burnt cheesecake is made by the Basque country, particularly San Sebastian where it is said that a little incident by a baker in the kitchen led to the global sensation when the burnt cheesecake has taken the world over by storm. In Malaysia alone, many cafes and restaurants offer this dessert to those with sweet tooth. I have tried most of the places I'd known but the Japanese version in The Tokyo Restaurant, tucked on the 4th floor of Lot 10 KL.. remained elusive as I hardly go downtown. My opportunity came when I had to meet a customer in downtown KL one weekday and I utilised the time in between to give this place a try. There is a lift outside the mall that gives direct access to the 4th floor where many Japanese restaurants have set their foot here. Since it was a weekday afternoon, the place was almost empty so we could dine in peace. The whole restaurant setup was modern and tastefully decorated with warm ambience - perfect to kill some free time and to enjoy your food or dessert or even a cup of coffeeThey do serve limited food such as salad, sushi, burger, etc but since I was there for one thing only, I couldn't comment much on these.I ordered their famous burnt cheesecake - so famous that I could spot many Instagram featuring it. At RM20 per piece, it's probably the most expensive piece of cake I'd ever tried in my life. The cake was served lying down on the plate with a dollop of whipped cream on top. It was soft yet bold, with rich cheese taste that cheese lovers would appreciate, or else it would be too rich for general palates. It instantly melt as soon as it entered the mouth. Perhaps the whipped cream's purpose was to mellow down the cheesiness of the cake and it certainly did a good job at that. Iced latte did its job to satisfy my caffeine needs.. using premium coffee beans hence the premium price charged After that we took a while to look around the refurbished Lot 10 - many establishments such as Sushi Azabu, Dashing Dining Says, etc... That I have not even stepped into yet. Time to discover more about it next time. For now.. it's a yes just to come and taste the famous burnt cheesecake.", "labels": [{"aspect": "burnt cheesecake", "opinion": "rich", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "burnt cheesecake", "opinion": "soft", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "burnt cheesecake", "opinion": "bold", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "whipped cream", "opinion": "mellow", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "tastefully decorated", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Iced latte", "opinion": "premium", "polarity": "positive", "category": "DRINKS#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "modern", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "warm", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "empty", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "famous", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "refurbished", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "tasteful", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#GENERAL"}]}

This dining experience invites us to enjoy a 5-course meal in five countries by igniting our senses with special videos played on the digital screen placed around the hotel's grand ballroom with special sound and light effects.This special trip takes us to Tokyo, New York, Moscow, Istanbul and back to Kuala Lumpur - places we definitely can't wait to visit in real. In each country, we are served with the country's special dish.My personal favourite was the dish from Istanbul and a Malaysian dessert (no spoilers given haha).The whole dinner takes about 2-hour and I was fully occupied with non-stop entertainment and was busy shooting videos or taking pictures of the unique experience to share on social media. In my personal opinion, this is not just the most instagrammable restaurant but it's an intelligent way to have dine-in at the hotel's grand ballroom with a grand setting and with proper social distancing arrangements.Well done to the organising team!I'll definitely bring my work colleagues and family to enjoy this experience.", "labels": [{"aspect": "dining experience", "opinion": "unique", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "dining experience", "opinion": "instagrammable", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#GENERAL"}]}

Breads and pastries were also available and were good. The breakfast also included pancakes and waffles. There were a few problems with the breakfast, and I hope the Mill Caf\u00e9 management will attend to these problems. The problems in the breakfast were as follows;1. At the caf\u00e9 entrance, I had to give the caf\u00e9 reception staff my room number. It looked like he had a printed log of room occupants. He also had a Computer in front of him that he used to print a registration form of multiple copies. I had to write my name, room number and sign this form. I do not know why I had to write this on the form when the Computer had this information and could have printed it. I also do not know why is the whole form needed when he had a log of room occupants. This is a lot of waste and causes time delays.2. The seating area is very dated, with very old carpets. In some areas there is marble flooring instead of carpets. The marble flooring is of Chocolate color (dark brown color), the ceiling panels are of Chocolate color, the tables and chairs are of Chocolate color and the wall wooden panels & dividers are also of Chocolate color.

There were only 3 people ahead of me, but this meant that I would have to wait 15 minutes just to give my egg order. Luckily, another cook came to assist the existing cook to make eggs. 4. For Western breakfasts, there were no grilled tomatoes or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms to go with the eggs. They did have hash browns, by the way.5.

{"text": "Four days ago, my daughter insisted that we celebrate my birthday dinner at The Steakhouse in KL as we are steak lovers. It was our first visit there.We were in for a big and beautiful surprise from the moment we stepped in as the staff made us feel very welcomed. Even though this isn't your typical fine-dining western establishment, the staff were so well-trained, polite, and professional. While ordering our food, Jubert, our waiter for the evening, suggested that we try the Black Angus Pure Certified Australian Angus Beef Medallion, it was so good. The next course we ordered was the Steak Bordelaise (to be cooked medium rare, of course!), never knew that such great steaks were available in Kuala Lumpur. Of course, the chef cooked the steaks to perfection, so kudos to the chef. Throughout dinner, the staff made sure that we were comfortable and not neglected at any moment. Superb service. Our bread basket was even replenished with a fresh one mid-way through our meal. After devouring our delicious meaty dishes, Jubert surprised me with a complimentary Werner's Special from the dessert menu as a birthday treat. It made for a sweet and refreshing way to end our already wonderful meal. Our special sincere appreciation and thanks to Jubert, for making our dinner a great one and my birthday very \"Special and Memorable\".We will always come back here for the best steaks and excellent service.Thank you.", "labels": [{"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "welcomed", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "well-trained", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "polite", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "professional", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Black Angus Pure Certified Australian Angus Beef Medallion", "opinion": "good", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Steak Bordelaise", "opinion": "great", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "perfection", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "service", "opinion": "Superb", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "bread basket", "opinion": "fresh", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Werner's Special", "opinion": "sweet", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Werner's Special", "opinion": "refreshing", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Jubert", "opinion": "special", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Jubert", "opinion": "appreciation", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Jubert", "opinion": "thanks", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "wonderful", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "steaks", "opinion": "best", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "service", "opinion": "excellent", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}]}
{"text": "Value for money French fine-diningThere's a reason why Entier is always booked out for their lunch sessions - good food with affordable pricing. And I only found out about this when she directed me to the obscure part of Brickfields where Alila Bangsar (technically the building is in Brickfields area but with a connecting bridge to Bangsar LRT station). \"Atceli I tried to book for many weeks already but it was always fully-booked\" she said. My heart melted when I got to know how she went through the hassle to surprise me, as I know the fact that she isn't very much a planner herself. Located on the 41st floor, we got ourselves a table by the window overseeing Brickfields and beyond. I kepoh a bit and took a look around - the restaurant was definitely full house and everyone was seen enjoying their lunch over chatters. Complimentary bread with kombu butter (which was heavenly by the way) was served as soon as we placed our order. I had to order a second kombu butter because it was so good. So there are two (2) options: 2-Course (RM108) without dessert or 3-Course Lunch Set (RM128) with dessert. Starters  Garlic & Escargot Soup - garlic veloute (soup); vegetable stock; escargot beignet; garlic croutons. So the escargot was deep fried with greenish colour dough on the outside and served on the plate which covered the bowl of soup. The idea was to pour everything into the soup and enjoyed like that. Salmon & Katsuo - cured Norwegian salmon tartare, nage of Katsuo, kombu dashi, salmon roe. Delicious but I could not help but to think that it tasted more Japanese than French. Mains Duck & Potato - duck confit Parmentier, mushroom, mashed potato and crispy tuile. I was impressed by the presentation of the dish. All elements combined well together to make my tummy happy. Butter Fish - butter fish beignet; sauteed pea sprout; mashed potato; pickled pearl onion. I took a bite and still prefer my duck dish. Given the choice, I'd normally go for red meat as main. The pickled onion did its job to cut through the richness of the sauce. Desserts Banana \u00c9clair - banana eclair; 70% single Pahang chocolate cream, yoghurt ice cream. I wouldn't order banana dessert if not for the other half who wanted to try it. Lovely dessert which was not too sweet yet got me wanted for more. Each set comes with complimentary tea/coffee or homemade kombucha (soda). Lunch Hour Wine Specials @ RM60 nett for any 2 glasses of white (Italian verdicchio), red (negroamaro) or pink sparkling (rose brut).Lunch was good, the companion was beautiful and most importantly, we left the restaurant satisfied with the overall food quality and service.

While we were looking at our menus, a waitress came over and asked if we were ready. We said yes, and she picked up the menus and walked away without taking our order! Eventually I got to order the lamb shepherd's pie with chips and peas. The pie was what you would expect to find in a downmarket supermarket's frozen section. The peas were mushy (by design) but not as they should have been. Best part of the meal was the gravy. My wife ordered the cod and chips and a side order of onion rings. Not sure what the fish was, but it wasn't cod. Telapia maybe. Cream coloured mushy flesh, not white and flaky. Yeugh!Service was below average. I asked for a fork and was presented with a pint of Tiger. They even tried to charge us for that later on!Valuewise, the food is not cheap, and poorly prepared. We both felt a bit ill later on.

{"text": "After a 40-minute attempt, including 28 phone dialing\u2019s to make a reservation\u2026I GAVE UP\u2026and I am SO GLAD that I did\u2026in my attempt to eat at Restaurant \u201cX\u201d elsewhere in KL.Super frustrated, I searched TripAdvisor for an alternate FRENCH RESTAURANT. AS A former 3.5-year resident of Paris, I was craving a few things\u20261) great TRADITIONAL French food, 2) a place to grab that nice meal on a casual Saturday and 3) to treat two friends after a year of Covid-mania! Our reservation for three was made a week ahead of time. We entered at 12:30, first one\u2019s there and were given a table we did not like. \u201cMay we change tables please?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026how about the window?\u201d\u2026YES nicer! HAMMER HAMMER HAMMER! The hammering next door was on the other side of the wall (reno of the next-door shop)\u2026and we asked them to have them stop\u2026and they did! RELEIVED!The space has a large main dining space and a somewhat separate bar are. The wood floors, bright white walls showcasing colorful art, and rich red velour dividing curtains make for a bright, and comfortable space.Seeing that my friend owns a fine wine import business in KL, he surprised me with two very nice French reds, 2013 and 2014 Bordeaux! The corkage fee is RM80 per bottle and we had some nice wine so worth it. We two arrived first while our third trailed us a bit, so we had some Pellegrino and opened a bottle of wine to let it breath. The Lunch menu has TWO fixed-prix menus, PLUS ala carte, plus a large wine and drinks list. The fixed RM140 menu is truly an offering of a starter, main course and a desert. The second RM170 fixed menu offers a starter, a main with a bit extra RM for three of the mains (a bit sneaky we thought). A lovely bread and Pesto Olive Oil dip were brought\u2026perhaps a bit too late.We all three ordered a la carte\u2026as we wanted to try some other things to share like the ratatouille (we ordered to share among three, perfect!). Our selections:We shared two orders of the Ratatouille and a large Pellegrino.1) Lobster Bisque > the Larger Wagyu steak w potatoes and gravy > Crepes Suzette > Double Espresso2) French Onion Soup Souffle > Lobster Ravioli > Crepes Suzette > An Espresso3) French Onion Soup Souffle > the Larger Wagyu steak > Crepes Suzette > A Double SambucaALL the dishes were delicious\u2026the service staff, neatly dressed in black, were attentive, friendly, and responsive. My meal arrived a bit on the cold side and I sent it back for a fast zap, something to address. We were at our table from 12:30 to 3:00 and never felt rushed\u2026until we were admittedly a bit surprised to learn that the kitchen closing at 3:00pm meant we also had to evacuate the premises\u2026while still having sambuca or wine or espresso still to consume. The time frames painted on the front door perhaps needs editing. We were welcome to finish our drinks on the front terrace, which we did, while we ordered a grab home.I would definitely consider this ONE OF THE VERY BEST MEALS that I have enjoyed in 6+ years in KL.I will definitely return. The menu\u2019s appeal means that it is likely meal options, water, wine and coffees may make a small dent in the wallet, so choose wisely and savor the meal.", "labels": [{"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "frustrated", "polarity": "negative", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Ratatouille", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Lobster Bisque", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Wagyu steak", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Crepes Suzette", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "French Onion Soup Souffle", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "attentive", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "friendly", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "responsive", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}]}

So I went up and ordered and I clearly said I don\u2019t mind paying, and the supervisor told me \u201c you are not allowed to order anything that is outside of what is already arranged for the dinner\u201d. Please note that they were only serving wine and lemongrass water for the dinner. Please also note that they were serving mugs of beer that was being paid for on Cash on Delivery Basis. You can just imagine my shock to what the Supervisor said to me. Water. A simple order which I intend to pay was rejected. Yet they could serve beer? What nonsense! I had to go the the seafood restaurant next door to buy water for my kid. Can you just imagine all that spicy food and you cannot get a hold of water?

The drinks were divine. I\u2019m fussy. I enjoy a sour mojito with ginger ale which I got right first time round, happy Saj! The food. Wow. Where do I start the lamb is cooked to perfect and presented so beautifully. The burgers were my kids favourite and the puddings were like no other. I cannot rave enough about this restaurant. Everything was 100% perfection and I\u2019m just so sad that Malaysia is so far I can\u2019t go whenever I want. Definitely a dining experience I\u2019ll remember forever. The restaurant manager was ever so attentive and lovely and added that touch of care knowing how comfortable we found the staff, restaurant and the food. If you\u2019re in Malaysia, be it business or pleasure please go try their lamb chops.

Sri Nirwana Maju Restaurant, as it is known, is at 43 Jalan Telawi 3, in Bangsar area of KL, a short cab ride from Sentral. It\u2019s a down to earth establishment nestled among some of the classy joints in this upmarket area. It\u2019s open from 11am to past midnight Yes, there was a queue, but not long, as we got there about noon. But the wait is put to good use as staff hand out menus, and are happy to explain various dishes. Once decided, they take your order and you wait aside. We had a 15 minutes wait in total, not bad considering it was Sunday. By the time you are called to your table, the food soon follows. The choice is huge; lamb, beef, chicken, seafood to vegetarian specialities. We ordered one of the house speciality, fish head curry with white rice, and chicken biryani as the second choice. Each comes with a selection of vegetables, pickles, dhal (lentils), papadum and fried bitter melon slices in red batter. We had fresh lime juice to wash it all down. You can go for fresh coconut or choose from a variety of fruit juices, or lassis, yogurt-based drinks. The food, which is South Indian, was delicious and every bit worth queuing up for.

Then a day before our reservation, someone from the restaurant called me to reconfirm and again i reiterated the no. of pax including adults & kids. I was reminded that they hold the table for 15 minutes only and if we were later than that the table would be given to other guests as they were full. On that day, we arrived sharp at 3pm for our Afternoon Tea, however we were told that our table was not ready as two lunch guests were still having their lunch at the table that we reserved. That was fine with us, however until 3.30pm we were still waiting at the lobby with no indication from the restaurant staff as to when we could be seated although the restaurant was more than three quarter empty! Then upon several enquiries, we were shown to the table, however there was a shortage of 3 seats! Once again the staff lied to us that they were fully booked hence we have to wait or we will be shown to a table situated upstairs of the restaurant. We were baffled because the restaurant was quite empty and they could have easily moved us to another table that was available which were in fact many.The staff were very incompetent and were pointing fingers at each other which was unprofessional. Then after some time they managed to combine another small table to allow us to be seated. This was all pretty embarrassing for us and for a YTL's property! Plus no apologies were forthcoming from them for making us wait for 30minutes!That was not the end of the nightmare for us as our first batch of savoury food took another 30minutes to be served which was after 4pm! This was totally unacceptable for us especially when there were only a total of 6 tables including ours that were occupied in the whole restaurant.Each time we request for a refill it took them forever to prepare and serve, so much so that we left by 5pm because it was getting ridiculous for a renowned restaurant to be so unprofessional and incompetent.In the end it was a total waste of time and money for us as we quickly had the food that was made available and left without refills. When making payment we were asked for feedback, I had voiced out the shortcomings and instead of genuinely apologising, the restaurant's assistant manager Eddy gave us excuses that they are new hence the kitchen was slow in preparing food and is not used to handling such 'big crowds' which was a total of 6 tables only! This is unacceptable to me! My family and I were kind of embarrassed by the episode that we had to endure that got us thinking 'perhaps we were treated in such manner because we were coloured people?'.I've dined at other YTL hotels in KL before and have always had a good experience. This is the worst ever and we are not stepping foot in this hotel / restaurant again!As for the food, most of the savoury items are deep fried and the desserts were too sweet with limited choice.

It is part of a group of restaurants at the 24th floor of Binjai that has nice views of the KLCC and the surrounding skyline. There were only two other tables with guests and they left early, leaving the whole restaurant to ourselves halfway through our main courses.For starters, we ordered the mixed Italian platter, a mozarella with tomato salad, and a green salad with anchovy dressing so that everyone could share and sample the various dishes. They were all freshly prepared and tasted really good; we were definitely not disappointed and enjoyed that together with the warm, fresh bread.For the mains, we tried the lamb shank, pastas, and the pan-fried chicken. I really enjoyed my spicy black spaghetti with crab meat. Again, they were very nicely done and we were all pleased with our food. To accompany the meal, we selected a bottle of Australian Shiraz which was the perfect complement.We hardly had any more room for desserts and decided to order only two - the panna cotta and the chocolate dessert - to be shared between us. But we did not end our meal until we've had our double expresso complemented by a shot of Grappa!Overall, the food and the staff service were excellent. We were given much attention by the waiters as we were the only ones there most of that Sunday afternoon.

{"text": "Heard it's highly recommended to make a table reservation for dinner during the weekend to avoid long wait at the door. I did just that, for my first visit: I called at 12.05pm on 8/8 to reserve a table for 2 at 7pm on the same night. Reservation was fuss free and pleasant. My partner and I arrived at the restaurant exactly at 7pm, saw many people waiting at the door. Gave my name to the friendly staff, and we were led to our table in no time. We had some beers and cocktails while waiting for the food. They arrived quickly, and the food didn't take too long either. We're both small eaters so we shared a plate of stuffed button mushrooms and half slub of BBQ baby back ribs. Both were very delicious. Our small plates were changed after we finished the appertiser and the food presentation was a plus point Portions were normal, so I'd not recommend normal eaters to share food here. My second drink was a half pint of hoegaarden. I saw the server approaching our table with it when a man (I think the manager) called upon her, asking why the glass wasn't full and told her to get it filled to the top. The server did as instructed and soon I got my beer, which was chilled and filled to the max. The place was very busy so it was very pleasant to see that the staff were friendly and alert to our needs. I plan to return to this place, and try other items on the menu. I hope this place will keep up the good job!'", "labels": [{"aspect": "reservation", "opinion": "fuss free", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "friendly", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "pleasant", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "food", "opinion": "delicious", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "food presentation", "opinion": "plus point", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "pleasant", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "staff", "opinion": "friendly", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}]}

{"text": "I revisited Wong Kee Restaurant after an 8-year break. The place is as I remembered \u2013 coffee shop with no air-con, people sitting at tables with no food on it, yet waiting patiently. We arrived just after 12pm, sat down and were totally ignored until the \u2018siew yoke\u2019 was ready to be served. Not too sure of the ordering system, we observed what the patrons at 5 other tables were doing and followed suit. We helped ourselves to the complimentary soup from a huge pot at the back of the shop, going back for refills. Boiled with large pork bones, ginger and salted vegetables, it is super tasty. A must try!By 12.30pm, all the tables are filled and a takeaway queue forms. The \u2018siew yoke\u2019 is brought out and hung at the counter, alongside strips of 'char siew' (grilled pork) and chicken. The lead waitress goes around the tables taking orders (choice of lean or lean/fat layer). We ordered one serving each of lean and lean/fat layer and one-to-go. The owner, Robert Wong comes out at 12.30pm and starts chopping the slab of meat into serve-size portions. The lead waitress has fantastic memory as she correctly delivers exactly what is ordered to each table, on a first-come-first served basis. This is no mean feat, with chicken rice and char siew (grilled pork) added to the mix. While not bad, these two dishes pale in comparison to the \u2018siew yoke\u2019.At RM18 per serving, the \u2018siew yoke\u2019 is not cheap. But you are assured of a crispy skin and soft meat that literally melts in your mouth with fat layers rendered to perfection. Even foreigners have heard of Wong Kee and are finding their way there, on their own.Highly recommended for \u2018siew yoke\u2019 loversUseful Tips: - easier parking on weekends- go early to avoid disappointment - be very very patient (can be hot)- sells out fast", "labels": [{"aspect": "siew yoke", "opinion": "recommended", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "siew yoke", "opinion": "crispy skin", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "siew yoke", "opinion": "soft meat", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "siew yoke", "opinion": "melts in your mouth", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "soup", "opinion": "super tasty", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "fantastic", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "chicken rice", "opinion": "not bad", "polarity": "neutral", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "char siew", "opinion": "not bad", "polarity": "neutral", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "easier parking on weekends", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "be very very patient (can be hot)", "polarity": "negative", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "sells out fast", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "PRICES#GENERAL"}]}

{"text": "We stopped here for lunch after a busy morning touring the Butterfly Park and Bird Park and before heading onto Perdana Botanical Gardens for a wander around the park (all within walking distance). The restaurant is located right next to the Bird Park and accessible from inside the park, but you don't need to visit the park to eat here.We had a delicious lunch here of mixed satay sticks (chicken and beef) with stir-fried vegetables and rice. It is great that in Kuala Lumpur you can buy the satay sticks with the peanut sauce on the side, I have a nut allergy but even I can enjoy the food here :-) although I didn't realise the vegetables are stir-fried in sesame oil so hubby had to eat them all - fellow allergy suffers be warned. We ordered 24 mixed satay sticks (which came with a little salad on the side), vegetable and rice meal, with 4 soft drinks and the total came to 111.80MYR, including the tip that is always included, so just over \u00a325. This is expensive for a meal in Malaysia, but it is a toursity area so to be expected. However note 3 times the price of our meal in Little India the next day!Great air conditioning inside, but also seating outside on the terrace overlooking the bird park and trees. We opted for inside after a morning spent in the sun!The food is super tasty! Delicious food, fast and friendly service and clean toilets.

The uthappam it is only available between 7:30 - 11:30am and 4:00 - 10:00pm. No worries, I tried the madras thali that was recommended by the waiter, and this starts at 11:30am!The thali was huge and believe it or not is unlimited, but I challenge you to eat the whole plate and need more. Based on a previous review I had to try the paneer butter masala and I loved it! It came with bread and was perfectly spiced for my tastebuds.I returned to once again try the uthappam, but it wasn't really to my liking. It was more like just a pancake with chopped tomatoes in it, but it came with all the delicious sauces. Being my last day (and because I was on time) I also decided to try the onion rawa masala dosa, which came with the same sauces as the uthappam, but I found it much more delicious.There are so many items on the menu that I know I'll be back the next time I am in KL.", "labels": [{"aspect": "madras thali", "opinion": "unlimited", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "paneer butter masala", "opinion": "loved", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "tomato uthappam", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "onion rawa masala dosa", "opinion": "much more delicious", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}]}

We ordered their ultimate signature burger and the locally farmed seabass. I was sceptical at first since the bun used for the burger was not to my liking. It was love at the first bite. Changed my mind entirely! It is full of flavour, and everything was perfectly balanced, the patty was juicy; medium-done just how I requested. Drooling continues with the crispy skin seabass with airy lemon foam at the side and black olive tapenade on top. How do you keep a crispy-skin seabass with luscious and tender in the inside? I love it! Wrapping it with pineapple semi freddo ice cream. The ice cream came with a twist of grilled pineapple on top and caramel sauce that was made from the trigona honey. I am not sharing for sure! To top this incredibly mouthwatering dishes, of course, the hospitality by the Curate team.

An apology by him was made nevertheless. By then, I gave up trying to speak to him and proceeded to order my food.

She was very friendly and welcoming, such an added nice touch.We had the fish soup again, my husband's favourite as he thinks its one of the best he ever had! We also had the charcuterie board which included two terrines which were really tasty.For mains, he had the pork fillet mignon while I had the weekend special which was a beef tenderloin. The pork was very tasty but the best was my beef. The tenderloin was tender and very juicy and it came with a lovely red wine jus. The menu said 180 gm but I think my cut was bigger than that, which was good.We enjoyed the meal very much, coupled with a bottle of nice red wine. Ambience was pleasant, still not air-conditioned but the many fans and open concept meant it was not stuffy.If you are looking for French food that does not burn a hole in your pocket, then this is the place to go to.

Just the right amount for us small eaters. Steak was cooked properly to medium rare, a seem-to-be-difficult-to-achieve-task in Malaysia in general. Thumbs up for that. Ox tails were braised nicely and stewed till to the right tenderness while retaining a bit of bites. The rice was cooked al dente, the true Italian way. Not the typical softer Asian manner.

{"text": "Good restaurants alas go into decline and then collapse, and add to the changing pattern of restaurants in places like Sri Hartamas. It may well be that the Malabar Palace has started on that downward course.I have been a regular customer at the restaurant since it opened some years ago. The food is very good and good value for money, especially at lunchtime, and the service is up to the high standards one can expect in Malaysia. The restaurant has even recently moved to a more attractive location in the shopping centre. The quality of management has gone up and down, and just very occasionally, standards have slipped. The few people who have given the restaurant a low rating must have been unusually unfortunate, or else they just don't like this kind of Indian food.I certainly wasn't expecting what happened at lunchtime just a few days ago. My wife was about to chair an important meeting, and so we were in a hurry. We sat waiting, but despite several reminders, our lunch did not arrive. After half an hour or so, it was obvious that the waiters knew that something was wrong, and so I went to talk to the man on the till, who I took to be the manager. As a regular customer, I wanted to know what the problem was, but instead of acknowledging that there was indeed a problem and apologising for the delay, he tried to pretend that all was well and that there was no problem at all. This put me in the position as though I were making an unreasonable complaint. Not being blessed with logical reasoning, he even insisted that it took up to 15 minutes to prepare a lunch, as though 15 minutes was rather longer than half an hour.When the manager insults regular customers, and talks nonsense that the customer knows to be untrue, you know that a restaurant has problems rather bigger than delayed lunches.

The beef balls were rather normal, like the ones you can get in the market. Soup is so bland, full of MSG flavours only. Noodle only rely on soy sauce, pretty much just salty and kicap taste, nothing else. What is there to shout about? I'd rather go for Ngau Kee Beef Noodles. I'm actually disappointed because I thought the original shop would maintain some sort of standards. In fact, I wasn't the only one who felt the same way. Shouldn't they consider increasing their QC or train their staffs before serving to customers?! Though, if you're after something quick, this would do justice. Food were all served in less than 5 minutes even before the drinks arrived. Call me bias but they kept switching people to prepare the noodles so it because so inconsistent.

For starters, we ordered the duck wraps, however the duck meat was not warm and the wraps were way too toasted. For a main course my friend and I decided to share the lamb shank which was a perfect portion for two. The lamb was extremely savory and tender which is a high-grade coming from an Australian friend. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake -it was marvelous! On the menu it doesn't say spicy, but once the waiter brought it out, he announced it as the spicy chocolate cake. Ps. The lava cake took 20 minutes to arrive just FYI. Overall, great dinner for our last night in Kuala Lumpur.

Plenty of varieties to choose from & I'd say, it takes at least 3 visits to sample all they have to offer.Sausages (various)\u2022 Freshness: 10/10\u2022 Authenticity: 4/10\u2022 Overall flavour: 7/10\u2022 Seasoning: Level of salt needs to be reduced by at least 30% across the boardMarinated cut (i.e. Pork belly)\u2022 Freahness: 10/10\u2022 Overall flavour: 9/10\u2022 Seasoning: Level of salt needs to be reduced by at least 20% across the board\u2022 Dipping sauce: Very tasty brown sauce but the overpowering white pepper sauce drowns every flavour any meat has to offer.Salad\u2022 Freshness: 10/10\u2022 Dressing: Honey balsamic vinegrette 3/10\u2022 Seasoning: Under seasoned, poor oil:acid:sweetness ratio & poorly executed emulsification.Jacket potato\u2022 Freshness: 8/10\u2022 Topping: Bacon wasn't crispy, sour cream lack acid & tartness, missing herb butter to perfume & under seasoned.Big thumbs up they serve grained mustard as opposed to American mustard Generally, service was quite quick once seated & order placed. Waiters asked whether ice was required with bottled drinks, opening & pouring them & checking whether one prefers to drink beer directly from bottle or glass.

{"text": "Several people raved about this place. After going there, I do not understand why.The pros:The service from the waiter is some of the best I've ever encountered in a KL restaurant, even in some of the top hotels. It's friendly, attentive, non-snobbish. Downright fantastic.The cons:The food. Don't get me wrong. The food is not bad. It's not fantastic either, it's just kind of slightly above average with a lot of frills to shill it as something extraordinary. They have a very fancy menu with reams of superlative information describing the food. Did you know that you can make any food sound fancy by adding the place of origin before the item itself? For example (this is not the exact item on the menu, just a demonstration of the style): Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops in Irish cream sauce, or Australian fillet mignion, served with Chilean asparagus or Tuscan rabbit or something (yes that was sarcasm). All these only serve to make the food sound more impressive than it is. There is even this really expensive dessert called 'And Ode to Newton' which has its own special card describing how it's anti-gravity and avant garde and all that, but basically is a scoop of ice cream on a wafer of flavoured ice on a glass of ginger beer. All for the bargain price of RM 25+This would not be such a bad thing if the portions were so minuscule for how much they charge you (RM 50-80 for a main). You order saddle of rabbit and you get one tiny little piece barely bigger a 50 sen coin. The duck breast was supposedly served with mash but what you actually get is a little dollop that looks like it had been served with a teaspoon.I don't mind paying for quality, but when a place is hyped but turns out to be so much style, and so little substance, it's really underwhelming. And honestly, if you paid 1k for one meal for a party of 5, I would have expected everyone NOT to leave the place hungry.

And again, they still managed to astound me.For starters, hubs ordered the truffled prawn(again cz it ws so good the last time) and it tasted just as it did before. The combination of fried prawns, truffle cream, honey and crushed nuts was praised by him from the start of our dinner til the end. Which by the way, interrupted my moment with Cafe Cafe's delicate foie gras. The texture was just right with apple compote and pears. However, the apple vinaigrette overpowered the dish a bit.For our mains, hubs had the lamb medallion. The honey lemon mustard dressing complemented the portioned medallion. He very much enjoyed the sauce and surprisingly finished his quinoas and lentils salad. I had the beef tenderloin and it was perfectly cooked as per requested(I love when people get my steak right). The meat was tender and well seasoned. The wasabi dressing was a bit much for me, I finished hubs dressing instead (wife material lol).To end, hubs ordered his all-time-fav, the creme brulee. Yeap, he did the trick(refer to my previous review on Cafe Cafe) again and our waiter seemed to be proud of the fact that he taught us that on our previous visit. He should be cuz we do that trick EVERYWHERE for our creme brulee. I had their chocolate cake and the center was heavenly molten.

{"text": "Skip lunch, have a fruit for tea and go crazy at dinner with Carnaval. It's all the meat you can eat, brought to your table by the passadors, or servers. There are two options to choose from: light meal and full meal. Save up and go for the full meal. You will be served an assortment of meats and dishes: beef brisket, lamb shoulder, chicken ham, glazed pineapple, grilled fish, chicken drumsticks, sausages, garlic beef, garlic bread. My suggestion, take one slice at a time, if you like a certain meat, ask for extras the next round. Just like any other buffet, form a strategy. Skip the carbs at the salad / rice / pasta bar. Attack the greens to balance off the red meat. Eat slow so that your body can digest better and allow more intake later. And have hot tea or hot water to ease digestion. You don't want to feel bloated midway through dinner. Have the pineapples with the chicken ham and other meats if you wish, I find that it helps with digestion too. Perhaps the enzyme at work? If you prefer your meat to be more cooked, you can request the passadors to 'fire it up' for you. Best to go with company as you can share slices of meat if it becomes too much for you. For a full meal, be prepared to pay RM92 per pax inclusive of GST. Be prepared to hear lots of moans and groans as teeth around you sink into succulent and full-flavoured meats.

{"text": "The visit to this restaurant was completely spontaneous and I guess the best experiences in life are usually unplanned. Entier has truly superseded my expectations. I\u2019ve not been this excited over a fine dining establishment in this country since Dewakan. To begin with, I am not sure if I should classify Entier as a fine dining restaurant. The interior and the quality of the food are definitely upscale, but it doesn\u2019t have that uppity snootiness commonly prevalent in restaurants of the same class where the stiff attitude is often more starched than the table cloths. The prices are very reasonable too considering the high level of sophistication in the food.Finding our way there was an adventure in itself. Although visible with the naked eye from afar, the tall black concrete erection known as Alila Hotel that has recently protruded into the Brickfields skyline, required some back alley exploration. Innuendoes aside, the real stimulation of senses took place on the plates of this swanky restaurant that shares the 41st floor with the hotel lobby.The ambience has an understated modern vibe to it that feels warm and inviting despite the clean, minimalist interior and monochromatic shades of nudes and whites. Let\u2019s just say that it wouldn\u2019t look out of place at all in the Monocle dining guide. The coveted seats are definitely the booths by the window, which afford diners unobstructed views of the city.Ordering is made easy with the smartly designed menu. Just think about what you want to eat first - beef, chicken, lamb, seafood, vegetables? And the well curated pages will guide you through the options based on the food you feel like having rather than on the conventional appetiser, main or dessert categories.The first dish that arrived was a vegan work of art that came straight from the Josper oven. The ash-free, pure charcoal heat of the grill-oven infused the tender Australian eggplant with a clean, smokey flavour. The pistachio dukkhah and sesame seeds gave it texture, whilst the saikyo miso cream added umami notes to the dish. A lot of thought went into what could have been just grilled eggplant.The chicken wing balls came shortly. It reminded me of Chinese Boxing Chicken where part of the flesh is stripped off, exposing the bone like a lollipop stick. This version is more like a minced meat ball, coated with crumbs, and served with Basquiase capsicum sauce. In retrospect, I am beginning to wonder if what I thought were paper-thin crisps of cheese in the dish were actually chicken skin crisps! Hmm... interesting.The seafood and beef dishes arrived together and what a pretty sight they were. Loved the sous vide Spanish Mackerel served with delicious lobster bisque, lily bulbs, bamboo clams and red spinach. I thought the inclusion of chilli oil gave the dish an added dimension of flavours and a local twist that reminded me of prawn mee.The Braised Australian Short Ribs was a paleo indulgence with a contemporary spin. The meat was literally fall-of-the-bone tender, the pea pur\u00e9e was smooth and creamy, and the hazelnut crust added a welcoming crunch to the meat. Pomegranate seems to be the in-thing these days but I am glad it had a real purpose in this dish; it provided that hint of acidity which helped balance the richness of the meat.I was already pretty full after all these courses. But it was hard to resist ordering the 70% single-origin Pahang dark chocolate souffl\u00e9. My only regret having this luscious, decadent dessert was the struggle to finish it. The size was clearly not for those who wanted something light.It was only after the meal that I read the restaurant\u2019s philosophy in the menu booklet. Entier means \u2018entire\u2019, which explains its nose-to-tail concept of utilising every part of an ingredient to minimise wastage. I did wish this concept was more evident in every dish though, rather than just through the inclusion of offal dishes which I did not order.I also found out later that the talented chef Masashi Horiuchi was formerly the sous chef at L\u2019Atelier de Joel Robuchon in London - that probably has some influence on the spirit of conviviality in this restaurant, despite its upmarket appearance. All that aside, I think what\u2019s most important is that the food delivered.

{"text": "We just need a quick meal at the Mall and we picked this place. There was a sign out staying that they they were full. When I walked in, there were 10+ open tables. That should have been our clue to leave. Ordering a drink took about 10 mins even though we sat right by the bar. They were not busy, just completely poorly organized and not really interested in SERVING. We had to ask for silverware 2 times. This felt like Soviet Moscow, not a vibrant Southeastern Asian Restaurant. The food was average to acceptable as there was nothing really wrong with it. It was okay food, just nothing to rave about.

{"text": "I have visited all 4 La Bodega outlets, Pavilion being the latest.Ordered the Egg Florentine and Pan Con Tomate.Florentine - Expected to have 2 eggs, but instead it had only 1.I reread the menu, and then I realized it...The menu did really mention only ONE egg.Guess the menu can be quite confusing, because the Eggs Benedict has 2 eggs, and both Florentine and Benedict are the SAME price.Pan Con Tomate - 4 slices of toast with grated tomato and cecina (spanish air-dried beef).My first time tasting cecina beef. Salty and flavorful, it is like a tapas. Below is my personal order of ranking for all 4 La Bodega outlets:1) Empire Subang - Better food.2) Bangsar Shopping - Comfortable and cool outdoor seating. Good service.3) Bangsar Telawi - Versatile, as you can choose to dine either in the deli, restaurant, or lounge.4) Pavilion - More expensive than the 3 other outlets, and service felt rushed.However, I guess no more return for me since La Bodega increased their prices starting 1 June 2018.", "labels": [{"aspect": "Egg Florentine", "opinion": "confusing", "polarity": "negative", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "Pan Con Tomate", "opinion": "salty", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Pan Con Tomate", "opinion": "flavorful", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Pan Con Tomate", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "Bangsar Shopping", "opinion": "Comfortable", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Bangsar Shopping", "opinion": "cool", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Bangsar Shopping", "opinion": "Good service", "polarity": "positive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "Bangsar Telawi", "opinion": "Versatile", "polarity": "positive", "category": "RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS"}, {"aspect": "Pavilion", "opinion": "expensive", "polarity": "negative", "category": "RESTAURANT#PRICES"}, {"aspect": "Pavilion", "opinion": "rushed", "polarity": "negative", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "Better food", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Empire Subang", "opinion": "Better food", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "Pavilion", "opinion": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "category": "RESTAURANT#PRICES"}]}
