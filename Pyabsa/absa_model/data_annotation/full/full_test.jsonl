The combination of fried prawns, truffle cream, honey and crushed nuts was praised by him from the start of our dinner til the end. Which by the way, interrupted my moment with Cafe Cafe's delicate foie gras. The texture was just right with apple compote and pears. However, the apple vinaigrette overpowered the dish a bit.For our mains, hubs had the lamb medallion. The honey lemon mustard dressing complemented the portioned medallion. He very much enjoyed the sauce and surprisingly finished his quinoas and lentils salad. I had the beef tenderloin and it was perfectly cooked as per requested(I love when people get my steak right). The meat was tender and well seasoned. The wasabi dressing was a bit much for me, I finished hubs dressing instead (wife material lol).To end, hubs ordered his all-time-fav, the creme brulee. Yeap, he did the trick(refer to my previous review on Cafe Cafe) again and our waiter seemed to be proud of the fact that he taught us that on our previous visit. He should be cuz we do that trick EVERYWHERE for our creme brulee. I had their chocolate cake and the center was heavenly molten.

{"text": "Skip lunch, have a fruit for tea and go crazy at dinner with Carnaval. It's all the meat you can eat, brought to your table by the passadors, or servers. There are two options to choose from: light meal and full meal. Save up and go for the full meal. You will be served an assortment of meats and dishes: beef brisket, lamb shoulder, chicken ham, glazed pineapple, grilled fish, chicken drumsticks, sausages, garlic beef, garlic bread. My suggestion, take one slice at a time, if you like a certain meat, ask for extras the next round. Just like any other buffet, form a strategy. Skip the carbs at the salad / rice / pasta bar. Attack the greens to balance off the red meat. Eat slow so that your body can digest better and allow more intake later. And have hot tea or hot water to ease digestion. You don't want to feel bloated midway through dinner. Have the pineapples with the chicken ham and other meats if you wish, I find that it helps with digestion too. Perhaps the enzyme at work? If you prefer your meat to be more cooked, you can request the passadors to 'fire it up' for you. Best to go with company as you can share slices of meat if it becomes too much for you. For a full meal, be prepared to pay RM92 per pax inclusive of GST. Be prepared to hear lots of moans and groans as teeth around you sink into succulent and full-flavoured meats.

{"text": "The visit to this restaurant was completely spontaneous and I guess the best experiences in life are usually unplanned. Entier has truly superseded my expectations. I\u2019ve not been this excited over a fine dining establishment in this country since Dewakan. To begin with, I am not sure if I should classify Entier as a fine dining restaurant. The interior and the quality of the food are definitely upscale, but it doesn\u2019t have that uppity snootiness commonly prevalent in restaurants of the same class where the stiff attitude is often more starched than the table cloths. The prices are very reasonable too considering the high level of sophistication in the food.Finding our way there was an adventure in itself. Although visible with the naked eye from afar, the tall black concrete erection known as Alila Hotel that has recently protruded into the Brickfields skyline, required some back alley exploration. Innuendoes aside, the real stimulation of senses took place on the plates of this swanky restaurant that shares the 41st floor with the hotel lobby.The ambience has an understated modern vibe to it that feels warm and inviting despite the clean, minimalist interior and monochromatic shades of nudes and whites. Let\u2019s just say that it wouldn\u2019t look out of place at all in the Monocle dining guide. The coveted seats are definitely the booths by the window, which afford diners unobstructed views of the city.Ordering is made easy with the smartly designed menu. Just think about what you want to eat first - beef, chicken, lamb, seafood, vegetables? And the well curated pages will guide you through the options based on the food you feel like having rather than on the conventional appetiser, main or dessert categories.The first dish that arrived was a vegan work of art that came straight from the Josper oven. The ash-free, pure charcoal heat of the grill-oven infused the tender Australian eggplant with a clean, smokey flavour. The pistachio dukkhah and sesame seeds gave it texture, whilst the saikyo miso cream added umami notes to the dish. A lot of thought went into what could have been just grilled eggplant.The chicken wing balls came shortly. It reminded me of Chinese Boxing Chicken where part of the flesh is stripped off, exposing the bone like a lollipop stick. This version is more like a minced meat ball, coated with crumbs, and served with Basquiase capsicum sauce. In retrospect, I am beginning to wonder if what I thought were paper-thin crisps of cheese in the dish were actually chicken skin crisps! Hmm... interesting.The seafood and beef dishes arrived together and what a pretty sight they were. Loved the sous vide Spanish Mackerel served with delicious lobster bisque, lily bulbs, bamboo clams and red spinach. I thought the inclusion of chilli oil gave the dish an added dimension of flavours and a local twist that reminded me of prawn mee.The Braised Australian Short Ribs was a paleo indulgence with a contemporary spin. The meat was literally fall-of-the-bone tender, the pea pur\u00e9e was smooth and creamy, and the hazelnut crust added a welcoming crunch to the meat. Pomegranate seems to be the in-thing these days but I am glad it had a real purpose in this dish; it provided that hint of acidity which helped balance the richness of the meat.I was already pretty full after all these courses. But it was hard to resist ordering the 70% single-origin Pahang dark chocolate souffl\u00e9. My only regret having this luscious, decadent dessert was the struggle to finish it. The size was clearly not for those who wanted something light.It was only after the meal that I read the restaurant\u2019s philosophy in the menu booklet. Entier means \u2018entire\u2019, which explains its nose-to-tail concept of utilising every part of an ingredient to minimise wastage. I did wish this concept was more evident in every dish though, rather than just through the inclusion of offal dishes which I did not order.I also found out later that the talented chef Masashi Horiuchi was formerly the sous chef at L\u2019Atelier de Joel Robuchon in London - that probably has some influence on the spirit of conviviality in this restaurant, despite its upmarket appearance. All that aside, I think what\u2019s most important is that the food delivered.

I personally can forgive that delay as the food was absolutely amazing and the way were taken care up until that moment was superb. Ingredients which they use are first class and that is the key for such amazing plates they create - whatever you choose to take. Also pay attention on their daily menu, its surely worth to check and waiters are very helpful telling all the details you want to know about the menu.

At La Fraschetta, I had an absolute perfect rendition of carbonara with bacon that was crisp and not greasy, pasta that was cooked al dente, and a beautiful sauce that was almost orange in color from the organic eggs. And, most of all, the dish was properly seasoned and not over-salted as many other versions are. This is clearly a restaurant where the locals eat and for good reason. They know how to prepare excellent, traditional Roman cuisine. It may be a little off the beaten path, but, it is worth going out of your way for the food.

We were greeted by the sommelier, and the owner came to the table, to welcome us and explain the menu, as well as the *local* sources of all their ingredients.

Each dish (it was Christmas Eve, and there were seven of them, all seafood) was so beautifully presented and created surprising taste contrasts and texture combinations. The staff is so professional, you never feel anyone is hovering, but you always have everything you need.

{"text": "We were warmly greeted with a nice prosecco. Our server suggested his 2 favorite pizzas and kindly let us know we were ordering too much food. We settled on the 2 types for the table and they even split them ahead of time so each plate contained both types. Hands down, the pizza with mortadella and pistachio pesto is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Even with our server\u2019s guidance, we still had too much food so our leftovers were packed to go. I was heartbroken when I realized our hotel fridge was not large enough. I tried to jam the last bits of pizza into my already full stomach but sadly, I threw some away. It was a pizza I never would have picked on my own and I am so thankful to our server for his suggestion. We also started with the zucchini flower appetizer which was very tasty.

{"text": "Without doubt, the worst meal I have ever had.I really do not understand the positive reviews this establishment has received, they cannot be genuine. This is our third day in Rome and we have eaten at numerous restaurants and this is by far the worst and most expensive.I ordered the \"Sliced Beef with Mushrooms\" which is basically steak with soggy mushrooms, that would not look out of place on a cheap fry-up. I clearly asked for the beef to be cooked Medium Rare, but, to my dismay, 90% of the beef was severely undercooked. We both ordered a side of \"Baked Potatoes with Rosemary\" and unfortunately, they failed to please. I am confident that my portion had 1 burnt rosemary leaf and no other seasoning. A lack of seasoning seems to be a reoccurring theme as my \"steak\" did not have a grain of salt or pepper on it.The service was pleasant and polite at first, but the waiter's demeanor changed when we did not order a bottle of wine (he even asked why we were not..). It was clear from that moment that we would be treated differently. Other couples around us were receiving complimentary shots of Limoncello, but alas, we did not.What was most disappointing, is that when reserving the table, we stated that it was our 10 year wedding anniversary and I am not saying I expected preferential treatment, but \"congratulations\" would have almost made the evening positive.As expressed earlier, this was the most expensive meal we have had in Rome (~\u20ac78 for two main meals and two drinks) and expected an elevated experience, compared to the other establishments we have dined in, during our stay in Rome.
