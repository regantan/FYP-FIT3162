But there's a big element of theatre in dining out, and as in the theatre, a bad ending can spoil the whole night. My rating reflects that.

{"text": "Just once in a while we get to experience \"Fine-Dining\" at its upper-end : in a Restaurant awarded the acknowledged accolade of a Michelin Star, and - if we're really lucky - very rarely, one which has earned several such awards. The up-market venues we've visited, in Ireland, the UK, mainland Europe & the U.S. have been generally excellent, but we did have extremely disappointing experiences in a 2* in London, and a 1* in Washington D.C.Now, this time around, we were celebrating the Birthday of M (my \"Better Half\"), and we had very high expectations of \"La Pergola\", on this very special night. We were absolutely delighted with our experience at this superb Restaurant.\"La Pergola\" is part of what's on offer at an elaborate Waldorf-Astoria Hotel/Resort, on Rome's outskirts. To be honest, we did not relate well to the elaborate, colourful but distinctly \"faux\", somewhat tasteless, surroundings in the enormous Lobby area, but from the time we reached the 9th Floor (where the Restaurant is located), things improved greatly.We were pleasantly received, and the courteous Maitre d' brought us to a Table which had great views, for all that it was, unfortunately, a dreadfully wet evening, where visibility was quite limited.We moved on, savouring all the elements of this experience. I have quite a few \"Food Sensitivities\", and had notified these (twice) in advance - the message had clearly been received, to my great relief.For people like us, who have eaten in establishments ranging from humble Cafes, to the far more elaborate, there are some fascinating (and somewhat amusing) elements to dining at this level : for example, you don't just get a comprehensive Wine-List (here there were 2 large volumes), but also a \"Water Menu\", offering options from various countries. Moreover, aside from the seductive list of choices on the Food Menu (here there's an 8 or 10 Course \"Gourmet\" offering, or you can pick from the range of Courses, as an alternative), you also have the added bonus of artistically presented, extremely tasty, Amuse-Bouches.From our Food selections, probably the better \"Appetiser\" was the \"Duck Foie Gras with Pear & Ginger\" - beautifully presented and subtly (rather than aggressively) flavoured. M was very disappointed with her \"First Course\", a Risotto, which she considered tasteless, and didn't finish - in fairness, the Maitre insisted she have at least a small portion of one of the Pasta alternatives, which she quite enjoyed.Our \"Mains\" were truly excellent. M's \"Leg of Lamb with Goat's Cheese & Brocccoli\", and my own \"Fillet of Veal with Chard\" were both remarkable in terms of texture and flavour.As we both savoured the wonderful Food, we also sipped some Wine : we shared an absolutely excellent Bottle of \"Falanghina\", while M also enjoyed a half-bottle of a \"Red\" she selected with some advice from the Sommelier - we both appreciated the distinctive \"Riedel\" Glasses.Nowhere, as we have discovered is absolutely \"Perfect\" : there was an excessively long delay in dealing with Desserts - we felt we had been forgotten ; there were similar problems with getting Tea & Coffee.On the other hand, the Restaurant gave an extremely nice, tasteful, discreet recognition to M's Birthday, which I had signalled to them in advance.Now, it would be utterly negligent on our part, not to mention the enormous contribution that Staff members made to our enjoyment of this special evening. We know only too well that there's a (very) delicate balance between being coldly \"professional\", and offering a warmer service, totally competently. All of those who delivered our Food & Wines were definitely professional, but more than that.We must give special mention to the Maitre, Simone, who was, from the outset, assured, helpful and friendly ; our Sommelier, Alessandro, was not just knowledgeable, but impressively avoided the all too frequent, irritating tendency to act as if Patrons know nothing about Wines - and, as he pleasantly and warmly engaged with us, he even displayed a sense of humour!Our Bill/Check was by no means inexpensive, but we did not expect otherwise.

You can definitely taste that while eating here. The waiters were very friendly and helpfull in chosing the wine during our first visit. We were taken care of by the waiters like we were old friends. Whenever you visit Rome you should atleast go there once to taste the delicious pasta. When we will be coming back to Rome we will definitely come back to this place.

{"text": "From the booking to the service, everything was impeccable. The food however varied. We loved the appertif and the extras provided by the chef. We ordered the three course menu.

The celery garnish and celery cream sauce went well with the octopus. For the primi dishes, we ordered oyster and veal ravioli. The veal ravioli was flavorful. We loved the horseradish cream garnish. The oysters was a bit disappointing. One of the two oysters was very fishy, almost as if was not fresh. The other was just right. The bed of risotto however was hard. For the secondi dishes, we ordered the lamb with carrot sauce as well as the red mullet. Again, lamb was juicy and perfectly spiced. The cabbage wrapped around the lamb was a nice touch. My friend enjoyed the mullet which was served in a fish consomm\u00e9 broth. As for dessert, wow! The chef treated us to raspberry sorbet lollipops, mini basil ice cream between two tiny biscuits, chocolate truffles (made in house\u2014 the lime was especially tasty), and lemon homemade marshmallow rollup. The service is unbeatable. Everyone was attentive. They noticed that my friend did not enjoy the risotto and offered to replace with another dish.

For appetizers on the standing menu, if in season, the squash blossoms stuffed with cheese, dusted by breadcrumbs and baked (not fried!) were melt in your mouth delights. One night of the two we ate at this restaurant during our five night stay, we split deep fried veal meatballs on a bed of celery root pur\u00e9e with a side bowl of a rich tomato sauce for dipping, and a poached egg with a cream sauce and shaved truffles....both delicious! For entrees, hopefully you\u2019ll be lucky enough to be there a night they serve a braised lamb roll stuffed with cheese\u2014-it was cooked to perfection. A veal roast with apricots and Marsala wine which we split on a second visit was equally memorable. I\u2019m told by some very picky foodies, the steak with balsamic reduction is fabulous too.

{"text": "I reviewed this place in 2017 when it was a great little spot for gourmet sandwiches and handy lunches. Based on my experience I was hoping it had survived the Pandemic and saw that it did. I made my choice of hotels in Rome based on it being open. As soon as we checked into our hotel after a long day and a half of travel, we freshened up and headed there. Our hotel was next door.It changed a bit. It was busier and have fewer sandwich options but a spectacular menu of the best pasta dishes you could want. I mean Michelin quality meals such as Ravioli with pesto. Such a creamy pesto based sauce and delicate and delicious ravioli. My wife had that and I tasted.I was going to have Cacio e pepe when my wife saw the fettuccini with oxtails and I got my order changed just in time. On a scale of 1 to spectacular, this was off the charts! A lot of folk are squeamish about some cuts but put your fears behind and try this.The food is made to order of the highest quality with creative presentations and really large portions for a price much lower than you would expect to pay anywhere in that location.It closes after the lunch rush is (chef and his wife work non stop when open) so go early and enjoy. You may have to wait but hold up the number of fingers to indicate the size of your party and they will get you in as soon as possible.

Keep going down to the quiet end of the street and look out for a small entrance with no outside tables and only seven inside tables.It may be tiny and does not take booking reservations for lunch,but it is well worth the wait if they cannot take you immediately. Luckily, we arrived early for lunch, about 1pm and were seated immediately. The son of the family was delightful and very helpful with our meal choices. The pork cheek spaghetti was a delicious version of Pasta carbonara and the Prosecco complimented it perfectly. Mother and Father were in the kitchen cooking and assisting when needed for service. How such a small run restaurant can be so efficient with the turnover they obviously have on a daily basis, is a tribute to the professionalism of the family. My husband opted for ravioli which he found excellent and complimented it with a local beer. By the time we left there was quite a queue for what is obviously a popular local haunt and we do not blame them for waiting.All in all we would recommend the Rione xiv to anyone and had we been staying closer and for longer we would have booked to return for dinner.

{"text": "We tried the 7 course seafood tasting menu. They modified the menu for a family member with food allergies, and offered equally delicious versions that were gluten and peanut free. They also accommodated a restriction of another food allergen that is uncommon, and outside the top 9 in the U.S. It was a memorable experience with each course artfully presented and delicious. We really appreciated their inclusive and easy-going approach to modifying the menu for food allergies. That way we all could enjoy the meal. This is probably obvious, but fyi the seven course menu is an experience that requires more time than the average meal. I am glad we took the time for the experience. We went to the restaurant without a reservation, and I explained that I requested a reservation via email a few days before but hadn't heard back.

Simply perfect for any wine lover and all the people who want to learn and taste something new and with place of origin. Food is here to accompany the wine and it works excellent. The ambient is very cosy and oldfashioned, in the best possible way. It is very intimate place with nice music and laid back atmosphere. Massimo, the owner, is the warmest guy in the business - he knows it all and will guide you through your wine and dinner with great precision and make you feel relaxed. We loved our last visit and highly recommend this bar to all the people who are openminded and wish to add another level to their Roman life, as well as to their eno-gastro experience.

{"text": "You only have so many nights to dine out on your trip in Rome. Don't waste time here. We wanted a special dinner for our last night in Rome. We are a family of 6 but we are complicated since 2 of us are Gluten Free and 1 is vegetarian. We had let the restaurant know of our dietary restrictions when we booked the table about a week to 10 days before our reservation.This was our fourth Michilen star restaurant of the trip and it was by far the worst. Their service was abysmal, they failed to accommodate special diets and their food was not memorable.  We looked at the options for tasting menu courses but because so many of them either contained gluten or meat/fish we opted to order a la carte instead. There were not 5 courses that we could have all eaten. The meal started off very rocky and did not improve. As we arrived, we were greeted with tri-colored potato chips perched in grape stems suspended from the ceiling by fishing line. They made an interesting centerpiece but we were encouraged to eat the chips. They tasted stale and under salted and they looked unappealing when there were fewer chips on the stalk. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters only asked my husband and I what we wanted as an aperitif - our other family were all in their 20s and it seemed very odd that they were not asked. I asked for a Spumante and my husband asked for a white wine but we were not given a wine list to choose our drinks - which seemed strange. My son and I have celiac disease and my son is quite sensitive to cross contamination. The restaurant provided each of us a rustic earthenware bread plate that apparently they do not wash. My son's plate, mine and my daughter's all had crumbs on them. My son sent for a fresh one and my daughter and I brushed ours off with our napkins. We received an amuse bouche that was a crostini with a fish topping and a macaron with liver pate in the center. For my vegetarian daughter they swapped the liver pate for a cheese filling. For the crostini they swapped gluten free bread for my son and I but they served the fishy crostini to my daughter and wisked it away with an apology but no vegetarian replacement. When they served my son his crostini it fell of the serving plate onto the table cloth. Instead of cleaning it up and bringing him a fresh one, they found a fork and spoon and popped it back onto his plate without much apology. Later, when we had ordered red wine for the second courses my son was provided a glass with 2 chips in it. They wisked the glass away and brought a new glass with the wine in it - without showing us if they poured it through a filter or anything to prevent any small pieces of glass inside. They should have thrown it out and offered us a new bottle of wine. The waiters left us a very long time with no water. They did not check back on us and left us for very long stretches. We were left so long after they removed the second courses that we were upset and asked for the check without any desert or coffee. They did not bring any petit fours or ather parting treat as is customary at this level of restaurant.

We paid for a six course meal but when you factor in all the aperitifs at the start and the complimentary dishes from the chef between courses it was more like a 10 course meal and although it was expensive it was well worth it for the experience. My only tiny niggle with the place would be that each time we were given a menu, my boyfriend was given the priced one and I was given the unpriced one which seemed slightly sexist as I was actually the one paying for the meal! Although I think this is more of an Italian thing in general and it definitely wouldn't put me off recommending this place to anyone visiting Rome looking for a really special meal.

My wife and I were on a short trip and weren't accustomed to Italy's later dining hours, so we booked the first opening for dinner at 7.We took a leisurely walk from our hotel but still arrived a bit early, around 6:45. Although they were still technically closed, the maitre d' graciously asked us to come in and brought us each a small bowl of potato soup, since it was a bit chilly, quickly followed by a glass of prosecco. A very nice touch.We ordered the tasting menu, and you would be hard pressed to find such an excellent meal for the price anywhere, let alone in Rome. The food was delicious, the service was attentive but not overbearing, and the decor was crisp and clean but not ostentatious. Across the board, the whole dining experience was top notch.The potato soup, prosecco aperitif, crispy fresh breadsticks and crusty local bread, bottled water, 3 tasty (if a bit small) appetizers, a wonderful main fish course, berries and custard prepared table side for dessert, coffee, and a limoncello digestif. Oh, and a nice bottle of DOCG Trebbiano that complimented the fish very nicely as well. 80 Euros for the two of us, no extra charges. Unbelievable.I have eaten thousands of meals at restaurants all over the world; the quality of the food, the service, and the ambience at Chiaroscuro made this one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have ever had.

{"text": "The pressure, stress, and hard work it takes to earn and more importantly maintain 1-3 Michelin stars at a restaurant, is nothing short of extraordinary. While I appreciate, understand, and empathize with the workers of these restaurants (have worked at incredible restaurants myself and have trained with 3 star Michelin chefs), I can't begin to say how frustrating my experience tonight at La Terrazza was.First, I will tell you the food, service, presentation, and overall experience during my entire meal was incredible and I can clearly see why La Terrazza earned the Michelin star they have. I wish I had written down the name of my server at the restaurant, because he was amazing and exemplified what the service we would all expect at a restaurant that has a Michelin star. That being said, let me tell you about my experience with the host of the restaurant.I booked a dinner with my new fiance to celebrate her birthday - two incredibly exciting and joyous events wrapped into one fine dining experience. I emailed the restaurant ahead of time (communicated with Daria at the restaurant) to secure a window seat at the restaurant to enjoy and experience all that is beautiful with their absolutely incredible view of the city of Rome. When I arrived the host seated us at the back of the restaurant. When I let the host know the restaurant had graciously emailed me ahead of time and confirmed a window seat (so I could surprise my fiance on her birthday), he told me I was wrong and they were full. I let him know the restaurant emailed me and secured a window seat (with a signed letter for their cancellation policy and a credit card confirmation) in advance. He then went ahead and printed out half our email exchange and brought it to the table I was sitting at with my fiance and tried to call me a liar for saying the restaurant told me I had a window seat. I then showed him the email where the restaurant said I had a guaranteed window seat, he then turned to the second page of his print out and said ok and escorted us across the restaurant to the corner and seated us near the window.This was incredibly frustrating to have my honesty and integrity called out by the host, with partial print outs of an email exchange - like, that is so crazy. I tried to enjoy the rest of my meal (that we paid over $600 for) and then at the end, he came to my table and said, \"Please pay your bill now, we have other people waiting for this table.\"While the food, our server, and most of the overall experience were fantastic, the host experience made me never want to eat at La Terrazza ever again.

Didn't even get to react - there was simply no time. Stared in disbelief and contemplated life for a bit. No matter if she actually believed I was done or not, this felt incredibly rude.Paid and left - could not be bothered making a scene about the 2 bites left, but I left with a sour taste in my mouth. I had to explain to them that I did not get the potatoes, as it said so on their note... My burger was okay - not NEARLY as good as the other reviews make it out to be, but okay.

{"text": "I had always heard that spaghetti carbonara was a classic Roman dish. But, I had actually had better versions of this dish in Sorrento on a previous trip to Italy. That was until I tried the carbonara at La Fraschetta di Mastro Giorgio in Testaccio. At La Fraschetta, I had an absolute perfect rendition of carbonara with bacon that was crisp and not greasy, pasta that was cooked al dente, and a beautiful sauce that was almost orange in color from the organic eggs. And, most of all, the dish was properly seasoned and not over-salted as many other versions are. This is clearly a restaurant where the locals eat and for good reason. They know how to prepare excellent, traditional Roman cuisine. It may be a little off the beaten path, but, it is worth going out of your way for the food. And, as a side note, Testaccio (which doesn't get much press in the guide books) is a wonderful neighborhood to explore.", "labels": [{"aspect": "spaghetti carbonara", "opinion": "perfect", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "bacon", "opinion": "crisp", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "pasta", "opinion": "cooked al dente", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "sauce", "opinion": "beautiful", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "sauce", "opinion": "almost orange in color from the organic eggs", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "dish", "opinion": "properly seasoned", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "dish", "opinion": "not over-salted", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "excellent", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "traditional", "polarity": "positive", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "opinion": "wonderful", "polarity": "positive", "category": "AMBIENCE#GENERAL"}]}

{"text": "Without doubt, the worst meal I have ever had.I really do not understand the positive reviews this establishment has received, they cannot be genuine. This is our third day in Rome and we have eaten at numerous restaurants and this is by far the worst and most expensive.I ordered the \"Sliced Beef with Mushrooms\" which is basically steak with soggy mushrooms, that would not look out of place on a cheap fry-up. I clearly asked for the beef to be cooked Medium Rare, but, to my dismay, 90% of the beef was severely undercooked. We both ordered a side of \"Baked Potatoes with Rosemary\" and unfortunately, they failed to please. I am confident that my portion had 1 burnt rosemary leaf and no other seasoning. A lack of seasoning seems to be a reoccurring theme as my \"steak\" did not have a grain of salt or pepper on it.The service was pleasant and polite at first, but the waiter's demeanor changed when we did not order a bottle of wine (he even asked why we were not..). It was clear from that moment that we would be treated differently. Other couples around us were receiving complimentary shots of Limoncello, but alas, we did not.What was most disappointing, is that when reserving the table, we stated that it was our 10 year wedding anniversary and I am not saying I expected preferential treatment, but \"congratulations\" would have almost made the evening positive.As expressed earlier, this was the most expensive meal we have had in Rome (~\u20ac78 for two main meals and two drinks) and expected an elevated experience, compared to the other establishments we have dined in, during our stay in Rome.

I had finished my carbonara as hers was brought out.No apology,nothing.Its a shame as the carbonara was actually pretty good, but the whole experience was very disappointing.
