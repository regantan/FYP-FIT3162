{"text": "The last time I was here, it was for lunch and this time round, it was for hi-tea. After checking out a few 5 star hotels in KL, Majestic Hotel's hi-tea is still the most affordable on weekends. Please remember to make reservations if you want to be seated near the windows. Personally, I find that the seats near the windows (with the current weather in Msia, it is too hot) is not comfortable. I'd rather be seated further from the sun. Anyway, there were 5 of us and we paid RM305 (inclusive of GST). We ordered 2 of the hi-tea sets (includes 2 trays of food & 2 pots of darjeeling tea) & a cup of cafe latte (RM25). Cafe latte is not worth the price (coming from a coffee drinker). Overall, the experience is nice but the food is just average. I would return for special occasion or big celebration.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "hi-tea sets", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "NULL", "category": "FOOD#PRICES"}, {"aspect": "pots of darjeeling tea", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "NULL", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "cup of cafe latte", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "NULL", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "NULL", "category": "FOOD#PRICES"}]}
