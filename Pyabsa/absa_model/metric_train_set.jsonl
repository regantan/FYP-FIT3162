{"text": "Being an indian in Malaysia, I grew up eating a variety of Indian food and my partner is from India and knows his lentils, curries and indian breads well. However, we like to try Oriental, Western and Mediterranean food when we go out. But on some rare occasions, we would go back to the roots and try a good Indian restaurant, although we choose our 'place-to-eat' carefully :)This past weekend we were craving Indian food. So after a bit of research we decided to try a small cafe in Bangsar called 'Ganga Cafe'. I was not expecting myself to be awed by the food but that changed the moment we tried the appetizer 'Samosa Chaat'. The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy and the crispy samosa chunks was heavenly.My partner had the Channa Bhatura and it was crispy with a tender texture with chana rightly spiced for our palate. I ordered the Parantha with Palak Paneer (Cheese Spinach) and I enjoyed every bite of my tongue tantalizing food. But the best part of our order was this amazing drink called Pranic Juice which just leaves you refreshed and awake after every sip. It is a mixture of mint, lemon and few other ingredients..Bottomline, if you like vegetarian Indian food you should definitely check this place out. It is delicious and value for money too.

We were greeted professionally by the staff and they all seemed to be fairly knowledgeable on what they offer. We had the 5 course menu and I would rank the appetizers and pre-main to be above their main course. My selection for main course was the steak. Hence comparing to other restaurants which predominantly specialize in their meat, DC would come short on that dish. Apart from that, the rest were great. However, one thing worth to mention is the attitude of one particular staff at the restaurant. We ordered a 2012 wine but when the wine arrived it was a 2014. I assumed that they brought the right wine and hence I did not particular note the year stated on the bottle. It was after a glass which I finally picked up the bottle and started looking at it closely. Only to realize they had serve me a 2014 bottle. When I questioned the staff, he said that they have ran out of the 2014. When I asked him why didn't anyone from the floor informed us, he replied me by saying sorry that they forgot to inform us.

We go up, order our starters (duck pat\u00e9 and scallop/crab salad) and main courses (chicken and pasta) and wait. After a while, a different waiter comes to tell us the chicken is only available for dinner, and brings back the menu. And we wait.... I mentioned that maybe it would be nice to tell the customers beforehand that a dish is not available, or maybe even mention it on the menu, there's an idea, if it's never available for lunch. Not much reaction, the guy takes the menu away without asking me what else I would like as a main course. I decide to let it go and see if anyone notices there is no second main course ordered. I have to mention that we are the only customers at 12.45 on a Saturday. Pat\u00e9 arrives, ok, nicely presented, average taste, and so does my scallop and crab salad a bit later. I start eating it and just cannot find any trace of scallops. I mention it to the waiter, who laughs, goes to the kitchen and comes back to say \"no scallops so we put extra crab meat\". Not the salad we ordered (and of course no mention of the change to the customer), no main course ordered, the Danish chef witnesses the whole scene and does not make a move to explain, let alone apologize. We decide to walk out, ask for the bill for food and drink consumed (it does come with no argument) and as we go out, we mention our discontent to the chef. His only reply (he is very shy or he really really doesn't care) is, we've not had scallops for 2 months... WHY NOT TELL THE CUSTOMER OR TAKE THE DISH OFF THE MENU ??? We told him that we understand that in Malaysia things don't always come out as they should, but a simple explanation or apology would have made things better when there are such blunders. Even better, get organised and tell the customers what they are going to get (or cannot get) before the order is taken... we really felt he couldn't care less... shame as this was a promising restaurant but we will never set foot in the place again.

{"text": "Burnt cheesecake is made by the Basque country, particularly San Sebastian where it is said that a little incident by a baker in the kitchen led to the global sensation when the burnt cheesecake has taken the world over by storm. In Malaysia alone, many cafes and restaurants offer this dessert to those with sweet tooth. I have tried most of the places I'd known but the Japanese version in The Tokyo Restaurant, tucked on the 4th floor of Lot 10 KL.. remained elusive as I hardly go downtown. My opportunity came when I had to meet a customer in downtown KL one weekday and I utilised the time in between to give this place a try. There is a lift outside the mall that gives direct access to the 4th floor where many Japanese restaurants have set their foot here. Since it was a weekday afternoon, the place was almost empty so we could dine in peace. The whole restaurant setup was modern and tastefully decorated with warm ambience - perfect to kill some free time and to enjoy your food or dessert or even a cup of coffeeThey do serve limited food such as salad, sushi, burger, etc but since I was there for one thing only, I couldn't comment much on these.I ordered their famous burnt cheesecake - so famous that I could spot many Instagram featuring it. At RM20 per piece, it's probably the most expensive piece of cake I'd ever tried in my life. The cake was served lying down on the plate with a dollop of whipped cream on top. It was soft yet bold, with rich cheese taste that cheese lovers would appreciate, or else it would be too rich for general palates. It instantly melt as soon as it entered the mouth. Perhaps the whipped cream's purpose was to mellow down the cheesiness of the cake and it certainly did a good job at that. Iced latte did its job to satisfy my caffeine needs.. using premium coffee beans hence the premium price charged After that we took a while to look around the refurbished Lot 10 - many establishments such as Sushi Azabu, Dashing Dining Says, etc... That I have not even stepped into yet. Time to discover more about it next time.

{"text": "I had breakfast in the Mill Caf\u00e9 while staying in the GMKL. The breakfast had a good spread of Asian and Western food with a verity of fresh cut fruit and chilled juices. Breads and pastries were also available and were good. The breakfast also included pancakes and waffles. There were a few problems with the breakfast, and I hope the Mill Caf\u00e9 management will attend to these problems. The problems in the breakfast were as follows;1. At the caf\u00e9 entrance, I had to give the caf\u00e9 reception staff my room number. It looked like he had a printed log of room occupants. He also had a Computer in front of him that he used to print a registration form of multiple copies. I had to write my name, room number and sign this form. I do not know why I had to write this on the form when the Computer had this information and could have printed it. I also do not know why is the whole form needed when he had a log of room occupants. This is a lot of waste and causes time delays.2. The seating area is very dated, with very old carpets. In some areas there is marble flooring instead of carpets. The marble flooring is of Chocolate color (dark brown color), the ceiling panels are of Chocolate color, the tables and chairs are of Chocolate color and the wall wooden panels & dividers are also of Chocolate color. This is very dark and very depressing.3. The made to order eggs station had one cook who would prepare one order at a time, with each order taking the cook about 5 minutes. There were only 3 people ahead of me, but this meant that I would have to wait 15 minutes just to give my egg order. Luckily, another cook came to assist the existing cook to make eggs. 4. For Western breakfasts, there were no grilled tomatoes or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms to go with the eggs. They did have hash browns, by the way.5. There are more people having breakfast during weekends, and the Mill Caf\u00e9 staff were struggling to clean and service the tables.I hope the Mill Caf\u00e9 management will upgrade the Mill Caf\u00e9 facilities soon.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "nels", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "seating area", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "cage panels", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "tables", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "chairs", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "wall wooden panels & dividers", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "staff", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "good spread", "category": ""}]}

While ordering our food, Jubert, our waiter for the evening, suggested that we try the Black Angus Pure Certified Australian Angus Beef Medallion, it was so good. The next course we ordered was the Steak Bordelaise (to be cooked medium rare, of course!), never knew that such great steaks were available in Kuala Lumpur. Of course, the chef cooked the steaks to perfection, so kudos to the chef. Throughout dinner, the staff made sure that we were comfortable and not neglected at any moment. Superb service. Our bread basket was even replenished with a fresh one mid-way through our meal. After devouring our delicious meaty dishes, Jubert surprised me with a complimentary Werner's Special from the dessert menu as a birthday treat.

{"text": "Value for money French fine-diningThere's a reason why Entier is always booked out for their lunch sessions - good food with affordable pricing. And I only found out about this when she directed me to the obscure part of Brickfields where Alila Bangsar (technically the building is in Brickfields area but with a connecting bridge to Bangsar LRT station). \"Atceli I tried to book for many weeks already but it was always fully-booked\" she said. My heart melted when I got to know how she went through the hassle to surprise me, as I know the fact that she isn't very much a planner herself. Located on the 41st floor, we got ourselves a table by the window overseeing Brickfields and beyond. I kepoh a bit and took a look around - the restaurant was definitely full house and everyone was seen enjoying their lunch over chatters. Complimentary bread with kombu butter (which was heavenly by the way) was served as soon as we placed our order. I had to order a second kombu butter because it was so good. So there are two (2) options: 2-Course (RM108) without dessert or 3-Course Lunch Set (RM128) with dessert. Starters  Garlic & Escargot Soup - garlic veloute (soup); vegetable stock; escargot beignet; garlic croutons. So the escargot was deep fried with greenish colour dough on the outside and served on the plate which covered the bowl of soup. The idea was to pour everything into the soup and enjoyed like that. Salmon & Katsuo - cured Norwegian salmon tartare, nage of Katsuo, kombu dashi, salmon roe. Delicious but I could not help but to think that it tasted more Japanese than French. Mains Duck & Potato - duck confit Parmentier, mushroom, mashed potato and crispy tuile. I was impressed by the presentation of the dish. All elements combined well together to make my tummy happy. Butter Fish - butter fish beignet; sauteed pea sprout; mashed potato; pickled pearl onion. I took a bite and still prefer my duck dish. Given the choice, I'd normally go for red meat as main. The pickled onion did its job to cut through the richness of the sauce. Desserts Banana \u00c9clair - banana eclair; 70% single Pahang chocolate cream, yoghurt ice cream. I wouldn't order banana dessert if not for the other half who wanted to try it. Lovely dessert which was not too sweet yet got me wanted for more. Each set comes with complimentary tea/coffee or homemade kombucha (soda). Lunch Hour Wine Specials @ RM60 nett for any 2 glasses of white (Italian verdicchio), red (negroamaro) or pink sparkling (rose brut).Lunch was good, the companion was beautiful and most importantly, we left the restaurant satisfied with the overall food quality and service.

{"text": "My wife and I were apprehensive when we looked at the online menu, which is enormous. Far too many options. How could the chefs possibly freshly prepare such a wide variety of dishes? Well, the answer is, they don't.We booked a table in advance, but when we got there they had no record of our booking. Anyway, the place was empty so no problem. While we were looking at our menus, a waitress came over and asked if we were ready. We said yes, and she picked up the menus and walked away without taking our order! Eventually I got to order the lamb shepherd's pie with chips and peas. The pie was what you would expect to find in a downmarket supermarket's frozen section. The peas were mushy (by design) but not as they should have been. Best part of the meal was the gravy. My wife ordered the cod and chips and a side order of onion rings. Not sure what the fish was, but it wasn't cod. Telapia maybe. Cream coloured mushy flesh, not white and flaky. Yeugh!Service was below average. I asked for a fork and was presented with a pint of Tiger. They even tried to charge us for that later on!Valuewise, the food is not cheap, and poorly prepared. We both felt a bit ill later on.

{"text": "After a 40-minute attempt, including 28 phone dialing\u2019s to make a reservation\u2026I GAVE UP\u2026and I am SO GLAD that I did\u2026in my attempt to eat at Restaurant \u201cX\u201d elsewhere in KL.Super frustrated, I searched TripAdvisor for an alternate FRENCH RESTAURANT. AS A former 3.5-year resident of Paris, I was craving a few things\u20261) great TRADITIONAL French food, 2) a place to grab that nice meal on a casual Saturday and 3) to treat two friends after a year of Covid-mania! Our reservation for three was made a week ahead of time. We entered at 12:30, first one\u2019s there and were given a table we did not like. \u201cMay we change tables please?\u201d \u201cYes\u2026how about the window?\u201d\u2026YES nicer! HAMMER HAMMER HAMMER! The hammering next door was on the other side of the wall (reno of the next-door shop)\u2026and we asked them to have them stop\u2026and they did! RELEIVED!The space has a large main dining space and a somewhat separate bar are. The wood floors, bright white walls showcasing colorful art, and rich red velour dividing curtains make for a bright, and comfortable space.Seeing that my friend owns a fine wine import business in KL, he surprised me with two very nice French reds, 2013 and 2014 Bordeaux! The corkage fee is RM80 per bottle and we had some nice wine so worth it. We two arrived first while our third trailed us a bit, so we had some Pellegrino and opened a bottle of wine to let it breath. The Lunch menu has TWO fixed-prix menus, PLUS ala carte, plus a large wine and drinks list. The fixed RM140 menu is truly an offering of a starter, main course and a desert. The second RM170 fixed menu offers a starter, a main with a bit extra RM for three of the mains (a bit sneaky we thought). A lovely bread and Pesto Olive Oil dip were brought\u2026perhaps a bit too late.We all three ordered a la carte\u2026as we wanted to try some other things to share like the ratatouille (we ordered to share among three, perfect!). Our selections:We shared two orders of the Ratatouille and a large Pellegrino.1) Lobster Bisque > the Larger Wagyu steak w potatoes and gravy > Crepes Suzette > Double Espresso2) French Onion Soup Souffle > Lobster Ravioli > Crepes Suzette > An Espresso3) French Onion Soup Souffle > the Larger Wagyu steak > Crepes Suzette > A Double SambucaALL the dishes were delicious\u2026the service staff, neatly dressed in black, were attentive, friendly, and responsive. My meal arrived a bit on the cold side and I sent it back for a fast zap, something to address. We were at our table from 12:30 to 3:00 and never felt rushed\u2026until we were admittedly a bit surprised to learn that the kitchen closing at 3:00pm meant we also had to evacuate the premises\u2026while still having sambuca or wine or espresso still to consume. The time frames painted on the front door perhaps needs editing. We were welcome to finish our drinks on the front terrace, which we did, while we ordered a grab home.I would definitely consider this ONE OF THE VERY BEST MEALS that I have enjoyed in 6+ years in KL.I will definitely return.

For the beef meat balls, they were served in another bowl full of soup. Well, it looks simple but till now, this is the best dry beef ball noodle in KL.I have known this restaurant more than 10 years ago and it has not changed much be it the looks and taste.

{"text": "Sofitel sets expectations so high that I\u2019m always nervous when trying their restaurants because I can be\u2026 very critical over everything.During our stay, given we have children we visited Kwee Zeen for the times we couldn\u2019t be bothered to venture out. Having already tried the room service and been blown away by that itself I was v excited to try Kwee Zeen. We went 3 x in total and I\u2019m so sad we couldn\u2019t go more!The service is next to none. Far up with Michelin rated restaurants and the creme de le creme of Dubai, where people get a high standard everywhere so the finest in Dubai is mind blowing. The restaurant, can be slightly over bearing. It is colourful but this suits the purpose of providing breakfast to guests as well as morphing into a restaurant in the evening for the hotel so I took it with a pinch of salt. The drinks were divine. I\u2019m fussy. I enjoy a sour mojito with ginger ale which I got right first time round, happy Saj! The food. Wow. Where do I start the lamb is cooked to perfect and presented so beautifully. The burgers were my kids favourite and the puddings were like no other. I cannot rave enough about this restaurant. Everything was 100% perfection and I\u2019m just so sad that Malaysia is so far I can\u2019t go whenever I want. Definitely a dining experience I\u2019ll remember forever. The restaurant manager was ever so attentive and lovely and added that touch of care knowing how comfortable we found the staff, restaurant and the food.

We had a 15 minutes wait in total, not bad considering it was Sunday. By the time you are called to your table, the food soon follows. The choice is huge; lamb, beef, chicken, seafood to vegetarian specialities. We ordered one of the house speciality, fish head curry with white rice, and chicken biryani as the second choice. Each comes with a selection of vegetables, pickles, dhal (lentils), papadum and fried bitter melon slices in red batter. We had fresh lime juice to wash it all down.

{"text": "I had personally walked into the restaurant to book a table for my family of 5 adults & 3 kids two days prior with someone named Masturah. Then a day before our reservation, someone from the restaurant called me to reconfirm and again i reiterated the no. of pax including adults & kids. I was reminded that they hold the table for 15 minutes only and if we were later than that the table would be given to other guests as they were full. On that day, we arrived sharp at 3pm for our Afternoon Tea, however we were told that our table was not ready as two lunch guests were still having their lunch at the table that we reserved. That was fine with us, however until 3.30pm we were still waiting at the lobby with no indication from the restaurant staff as to when we could be seated although the restaurant was more than three quarter empty! Then upon several enquiries, we were shown to the table, however there was a shortage of 3 seats! Once again the staff lied to us that they were fully booked hence we have to wait or we will be shown to a table situated upstairs of the restaurant. We were baffled because the restaurant was quite empty and they could have easily moved us to another table that was available which were in fact many.The staff were very incompetent and were pointing fingers at each other which was unprofessional. Then after some time they managed to combine another small table to allow us to be seated. This was all pretty embarrassing for us and for a YTL's property! Plus no apologies were forthcoming from them for making us wait for 30minutes!That was not the end of the nightmare for us as our first batch of savoury food took another 30minutes to be served which was after 4pm! This was totally unacceptable for us especially when there were only a total of 6 tables including ours that were occupied in the whole restaurant.Each time we request for a refill it took them forever to prepare and serve, so much so that we left by 5pm because it was getting ridiculous for a renowned restaurant to be so unprofessional and incompetent.In the end it was a total waste of time and money for us as we quickly had the food that was made available and left without refills. When making payment we were asked for feedback, I had voiced out the shortcomings and instead of genuinely apologising, the restaurant's assistant manager Eddy gave us excuses that they are new hence the kitchen was slow in preparing food and is not used to handling such 'big crowds' which was a total of 6 tables only! This is unacceptable to me! My family and I were kind of embarrassed by the episode that we had to endure that got us thinking 'perhaps we were treated in such manner because we were coloured people?'.I've dined at other YTL hotels in KL before and have always had a good experience. This is the worst ever and we are not stepping foot in this hotel / restaurant again!As for the food, most of the savoury items are deep fried and the desserts were too sweet with limited choice.

My partner and I arrived at the restaurant exactly at 7pm, saw many people waiting at the door. Gave my name to the friendly staff, and we were led to our table in no time. We had some beers and cocktails while waiting for the food. They arrived quickly, and the food didn't take too long either. We're both small eaters so we shared a plate of stuffed button mushrooms and half slub of BBQ baby back ribs. Both were very delicious. Our small plates were changed after we finished the appertiser and the food presentation was a plus point Portions were normal, so I'd not recommend normal eaters to share food here. My second drink was a half pint of hoegaarden. I saw the server approaching our table with it when a man (I think the manager) called upon her, asking why the glass wasn't full and told her to get it filled to the top. The server did as instructed and soon I got my beer, which was chilled and filled to the max.

{"text": "I revisited Wong Kee Restaurant after an 8-year break. The place is as I remembered \u2013 coffee shop with no air-con, people sitting at tables with no food on it, yet waiting patiently. We arrived just after 12pm, sat down and were totally ignored until the \u2018siew yoke\u2019 was ready to be served. Not too sure of the ordering system, we observed what the patrons at 5 other tables were doing and followed suit. We helped ourselves to the complimentary soup from a huge pot at the back of the shop, going back for refills. Boiled with large pork bones, ginger and salted vegetables, it is super tasty. A must try!By 12.30pm, all the tables are filled and a takeaway queue forms. The \u2018siew yoke\u2019 is brought out and hung at the counter, alongside strips of 'char siew' (grilled pork) and chicken. The lead waitress goes around the tables taking orders (choice of lean or lean/fat layer). We ordered one serving each of lean and lean/fat layer and one-to-go. The owner, Robert Wong comes out at 12.30pm and starts chopping the slab of meat into serve-size portions. The lead waitress has fantastic memory as she correctly delivers exactly what is ordered to each table, on a first-come-first served basis. This is no mean feat, with chicken rice and char siew (grilled pork) added to the mix. While not bad, these two dishes pale in comparison to the \u2018siew yoke\u2019.At RM18 per serving, the \u2018siew yoke\u2019 is not cheap. But you are assured of a crispy skin and soft meat that literally melts in your mouth with fat layers rendered to perfection. Even foreigners have heard of Wong Kee and are finding their way there, on their own.Highly recommended for \u2018siew yoke\u2019 loversUseful Tips: - easier parking on weekends- go early to avoid disappointment - be very very patient (can be hot)- sells out fast", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "yoke", "polarity": "", "opinion": "", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "super tasty", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}]}

The uthappam it is only available between 7:30 - 11:30am and 4:00 - 10:00pm. No worries, I tried the madras thali that was recommended by the waiter, and this starts at 11:30am!The thali was huge and believe it or not is unlimited, but I challenge you to eat the whole plate and need more. Based on a previous review I had to try the paneer butter masala and I loved it! It came with bread and was perfectly spiced for my tastebuds.I returned to once again try the uthappam, but it wasn't really to my liking. It was more like just a pancake with chopped tomatoes in it, but it came with all the delicious sauces. Being my last day (and because I was on time) I also decided to try the onion rawa masala dosa, which came with the same sauces as the uthappam, but I found it much more delicious.There are so many items on the menu that I know I'll be back the next time I am in KL.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "madras thali", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "huge", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "paneer butter masala", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "loved", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}, {"aspect": "onion rawa masala dosa", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "delicious", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "fabulous", "category": "FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS"}]}

We ordered their ultimate signature burger and the locally farmed seabass. I was sceptical at first since the bun used for the burger was not to my liking. It was love at the first bite. Changed my mind entirely! It is full of flavour, and everything was perfectly balanced, the patty was juicy; medium-done just how I requested. Drooling continues with the crispy skin seabass with airy lemon foam at the side and black olive tapenade on top. How do you keep a crispy-skin seabass with luscious and tender in the inside? I love it! Wrapping it with pineapple semi freddo ice cream. The ice cream came with a twist of grilled pineapple on top and caramel sauce that was made from the trigona honey. I am not sharing for sure! To top this incredibly mouthwatering dishes, of course, the hospitality by the Curate team.

{"text": "One of the worst group of staff I have encountered, right from the top to the bottom. Made a reservation for 8pm but I had to ask multiple times and argued to get a table by 8:30pm. The staff told me to wait at the door but didn\u2019t say much. I then proceed to ask him again and he just waved me off. I then ask another staff, and he said our table are still occupied by existing customers as they decided to order dessert and they are taking longer than expected. I then asked to speak to the boss, and I was pretty sure I caught his attention while speaking to his staff, but the boss chose to avoid speaking to me. By 8:30pm, the staff said I can be seated at a little tiny table by the entrance or at the outdoor area, which was not desirable since I didn\u2019t want to wait. Had to go through a massive debate and argument then I finally got a more decent table at the main part of the restaurant. All of these are a result of making a reservation up front and hoping everything will be smooth. So much I had to beg to be placed at a decent area of the restaurant. The highlight of the night of course is, when the boss finally came to speak to me, he told me that it is normal to wait for a table (but 30 minutes???) in restaurants, let alone Marta\u2019s kitchen is a large restaurant therefore it\u2019s perfectly normal. An apology by him was made nevertheless. By then, I gave up trying to speak to him and proceeded to order my food.

There was a French lady manning the front of the house and we learnt later from Chef Flo that she is a friend helping him out. She was very friendly and welcoming, such an added nice touch.We had the fish soup again, my husband's favourite as he thinks its one of the best he ever had! We also had the charcuterie board which included two terrines which were really tasty.For mains, he had the pork fillet mignon while I had the weekend special which was a beef tenderloin. The pork was very tasty but the best was my beef. The tenderloin was tender and very juicy and it came with a lovely red wine jus. The menu said 180 gm but I think my cut was bigger than that, which was good.We enjoyed the meal very much, coupled with a bottle of nice red wine. Ambience was pleasant, still not air-conditioned but the many fans and open concept meant it was not stuffy.If you are looking for French food that does not burn a hole in your pocket, then this is the place to go to.

{"text": "Good restaurants alas go into decline and then collapse, and add to the changing pattern of restaurants in places like Sri Hartamas. It may well be that the Malabar Palace has started on that downward course.I have been a regular customer at the restaurant since it opened some years ago. The food is very good and good value for money, especially at lunchtime, and the service is up to the high standards one can expect in Malaysia. The restaurant has even recently moved to a more attractive location in the shopping centre. The quality of management has gone up and down, and just very occasionally, standards have slipped. The few people who have given the restaurant a low rating must have been unusually unfortunate, or else they just don't like this kind of Indian food.I certainly wasn't expecting what happened at lunchtime just a few days ago. My wife was about to chair an important meeting, and so we were in a hurry. We sat waiting, but despite several reminders, our lunch did not arrive. After half an hour or so, it was obvious that the waiters knew that something was wrong, and so I went to talk to the man on the till, who I took to be the manager. As a regular customer, I wanted to know what the problem was, but instead of acknowledging that there was indeed a problem and apologising for the delay, he tried to pretend that all was well and that there was no problem at all. This put me in the position as though I were making an unreasonable complaint. Not being blessed with logical reasoning, he even insisted that it took up to 15 minutes to prepare a lunch, as though 15 minutes was rather longer than half an hour.When the manager insults regular customers, and talks nonsense that the customer knows to be untrue, you know that a restaurant has problems rather bigger than delayed lunches.

{"text": "We decided to look on Trip Advisor for a restaurant nearby the One World Hotel and we found this one that had very good reviews and was top top-five. We get to concierge to ask about reservations and he said we could walk in---sure enough we were super excited to find out that there was a table open once we arrived at 6 PM the time of opening for the restaurant. We got a great table with a view of the city however, the weather did not hold up and we weren't able to see that gorgeous skyline and the sunset that would've been. For starters, we ordered the duck wraps, however the duck meat was not warm and the wraps were way too toasted. For a main course my friend and I decided to share the lamb shank which was a perfect portion for two. The lamb was extremely savory and tender which is a high-grade coming from an Australian friend. For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake -it was marvelous! On the menu it doesn't say spicy, but once the waiter brought it out, he announced it as the spicy chocolate cake. Ps. The lava cake took 20 minutes to arrive just FYI. Overall, great dinner for our last night in Kuala Lumpur.

{"text": "Several people raved about this place. After going there, I do not understand why.The pros:The service from the waiter is some of the best I've ever encountered in a KL restaurant, even in some of the top hotels. It's friendly, attentive, non-snobbish. Downright fantastic.The cons:The food. Don't get me wrong. The food is not bad. It's not fantastic either, it's just kind of slightly above average with a lot of frills to shill it as something extraordinary. They have a very fancy menu with reams of superlative information describing the food. Did you know that you can make any food sound fancy by adding the place of origin before the item itself? For example (this is not the exact item on the menu, just a demonstration of the style): Pan-seared Hokkaido scallops in Irish cream sauce, or Australian fillet mignion, served with Chilean asparagus or Tuscan rabbit or something (yes that was sarcasm). All these only serve to make the food sound more impressive than it is. There is even this really expensive dessert called 'And Ode to Newton' which has its own special card describing how it's anti-gravity and avant garde and all that, but basically is a scoop of ice cream on a wafer of flavoured ice on a glass of ginger beer. All for the bargain price of RM 25+This would not be such a bad thing if the portions were so minuscule for how much they charge you (RM 50-80 for a main). You order saddle of rabbit and you get one tiny little piece barely bigger a 50 sen coin. The duck breast was supposedly served with mash but what you actually get is a little dollop that looks like it had been served with a teaspoon.I don't mind paying for quality, but when a place is hyped but turns out to be so much style, and so little substance, it's really underwhelming. And honestly, if you paid 1k for one meal for a party of 5, I would have expected everyone NOT to leave the place hungry. The only way I'd ever recommend this restaurant to anyone if they and their wallet want a bit of weight loss, and if you enjoy the ambience and the prestige of having that kind of money to burn, I suppose.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "service", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "best", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "food", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "fantastic", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "menu", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "friendly", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "portions", "polarity": "neutral", "opinion": "attentive", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "fantastic", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "portions", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "not bad", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "duck breast", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "not fantastic", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}]}

Did we offend somebody? Or is it just one of those restaurants that loses interest when they feel they've finished with customers? I have no idea. But there's a big element of theatre in dining out, and as in the theatre, a bad ending can spoil the whole night. My rating reflects that.

{"text": "Just once in a while we get to experience \"Fine-Dining\" at its upper-end : in a Restaurant awarded the acknowledged accolade of a Michelin Star, and - if we're really lucky - very rarely, one which has earned several such awards. The up-market venues we've visited, in Ireland, the UK, mainland Europe & the U.S. have been generally excellent, but we did have extremely disappointing experiences in a 2* in London, and a 1* in Washington D.C.Now, this time around, we were celebrating the Birthday of M (my \"Better Half\"), and we had very high expectations of \"La Pergola\", on this very special night. We were absolutely delighted with our experience at this superb Restaurant.\"La Pergola\" is part of what's on offer at an elaborate Waldorf-Astoria Hotel/Resort, on Rome's outskirts. To be honest, we did not relate well to the elaborate, colourful but distinctly \"faux\", somewhat tasteless, surroundings in the enormous Lobby area, but from the time we reached the 9th Floor (where the Restaurant is located), things improved greatly.We were pleasantly received, and the courteous Maitre d' brought us to a Table which had great views, for all that it was, unfortunately, a dreadfully wet evening, where visibility was quite limited.We moved on, savouring all the elements of this experience. I have quite a few \"Food Sensitivities\", and had notified these (twice) in advance - the message had clearly been received, to my great relief.For people like us, who have eaten in establishments ranging from humble Cafes, to the far more elaborate, there are some fascinating (and somewhat amusing) elements to dining at this level : for example, you don't just get a comprehensive Wine-List (here there were 2 large volumes), but also a \"Water Menu\", offering options from various countries. Moreover, aside from the seductive list of choices on the Food Menu (here there's an 8 or 10 Course \"Gourmet\" offering, or you can pick from the range of Courses, as an alternative), you also have the added bonus of artistically presented, extremely tasty, Amuse-Bouches.From our Food selections, probably the better \"Appetiser\" was the \"Duck Foie Gras with Pear & Ginger\" - beautifully presented and subtly (rather than aggressively) flavoured. M was very disappointed with her \"First Course\", a Risotto, which she considered tasteless, and didn't finish - in fairness, the Maitre insisted she have at least a small portion of one of the Pasta alternatives, which she quite enjoyed.Our \"Mains\" were truly excellent. M's \"Leg of Lamb with Goat's Cheese & Brocccoli\", and my own \"Fillet of Veal with Chard\" were both remarkable in terms of texture and flavour.As we both savoured the wonderful Food, we also sipped some Wine : we shared an absolutely excellent Bottle of \"Falanghina\", while M also enjoyed a half-bottle of a \"Red\" she selected with some advice from the Sommelier - we both appreciated the distinctive \"Riedel\" Glasses.Nowhere, as we have discovered is absolutely \"Perfect\" : there was an excessively long delay in dealing with Desserts - we felt we had been forgotten ; there were similar problems with getting Tea & Coffee.On the other hand, the Restaurant gave an extremely nice, tasteful, discreet recognition to M's Birthday, which I had signalled to them in advance.Now, it would be utterly negligent on our part, not to mention the enormous contribution that Staff members made to our enjoyment of this special evening. We know only too well that there's a (very) delicate balance between being coldly \"professional\", and offering a warmer service, totally competently. All of those who delivered our Food & Wines were definitely professional, but more than that.We must give special mention to the Maitre, Simone, who was, from the outset, assured, helpful and friendly ; our Sommelier, Alessandro, was not just knowledgeable, but impressively avoided the all too frequent, irritating tendency to act as if Patrons know nothing about Wines - and, as he pleasantly and warmly engaged with us, he even displayed a sense of humour!Our Bill/Check was by no means inexpensive, but we did not expect otherwise. My last note to myself on the night says : \"We've been in equally rated Restaurants before, but this one particularly registered with us, for all the best reasons\"!\"Grazie Mille\" to Simone, Alessandro + all their colleagues who looked-after us so, so well!", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "food sensitivities", "polarity": "", "opinion": "delighted", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}]}

So happy that it was in the same block with our apartment, we stopped one morning for coffee and snack. First off, this appears to be a self-serve place, though the prices are consistent with a regular restaurant of this kind. What had shocked me initially was the fact that the beautiful trendy bar-height tables were covered in food leftovers and croissant flakes. Even my 5 year old daughter exclaimed: Mommy look, someone ate croissant here! Two young gentlemen working there didn't seem concerned about it at all. Cappuccino they made was barely warm. I asked for a salad to go, when opened an hour later, all lettuce was saggy, but the majority of salad consisted of sliced carrots.

We chose the squid and octopus dishes as starters. The squid was smooth and delicious. The octopus has great flavor but was a little bit hard. The celery garnish and celery cream sauce went well with the octopus. For the primi dishes, we ordered oyster and veal ravioli. The veal ravioli was flavorful. We loved the horseradish cream garnish. The oysters was a bit disappointing. One of the two oysters was very fishy, almost as if was not fresh. The other was just right. The bed of risotto however was hard. For the secondi dishes, we ordered the lamb with carrot sauce as well as the red mullet. Again, lamb was juicy and perfectly spiced. The cabbage wrapped around the lamb was a nice touch. My friend enjoyed the mullet which was served in a fish consomm\u00e9 broth. As for dessert, wow! The chef treated us to raspberry sorbet lollipops, mini basil ice cream between two tiny biscuits, chocolate truffles (made in house\u2014 the lime was especially tasty), and lemon homemade marshmallow rollup. The service is unbeatable. Everyone was attentive. They noticed that my friend did not enjoy the risotto and offered to replace with another dish.

I mean Michelin quality meals such as Ravioli with pesto. Such a creamy pesto based sauce and delicate and delicious ravioli. My wife had that and I tasted.I was going to have Cacio e pepe when my wife saw the fettuccini with oxtails and I got my order changed just in time. On a scale of 1 to spectacular, this was off the charts!

{"text": "Having found Rome very expensive and not necessarily worth the cost, it was a pure delight to find the Rione xiv.After an exhausting visit round the Sistine chapel and gardens, we followed the wall of the Vatican all the way round to the Borgo Pio. Do not be put off by the many other restaurants in that street, whose waiters are all imploring one to come in for the best meal in town. Keep going down to the quiet end of the street and look out for a small entrance with no outside tables and only seven inside tables.It may be tiny and does not take booking reservations for lunch,but it is well worth the wait if they cannot take you immediately. Luckily, we arrived early for lunch, about 1pm and were seated immediately. The son of the family was delightful and very helpful with our meal choices. The pork cheek spaghetti was a delicious version of Pasta carbonara and the Prosecco complimented it perfectly. Mother and Father were in the kitchen cooking and assisting when needed for service. How such a small run restaurant can be so efficient with the turnover they obviously have on a daily basis, is a tribute to the professionalism of the family. My husband opted for ravioli which he found excellent and complimented it with a local beer. By the time we left there was quite a queue for what is obviously a popular local haunt and we do not blame them for waiting.All in all we would recommend the Rione xiv to anyone and had we been staying closer and for longer we would have booked to return for dinner. We feel sure cheaper places can be found if you just want a pasta to fill you up.

We are a family of 6 but we are complicated since 2 of us are Gluten Free and 1 is vegetarian. We had let the restaurant know of our dietary restrictions when we booked the table about a week to 10 days before our reservation.This was our fourth Michilen star restaurant of the trip and it was by far the worst. Their service was abysmal, they failed to accommodate special diets and their food was not memorable.  We looked at the options for tasting menu courses but because so many of them either contained gluten or meat/fish we opted to order a la carte instead. There were not 5 courses that we could have all eaten. The meal started off very rocky and did not improve. As we arrived, we were greeted with tri-colored potato chips perched in grape stems suspended from the ceiling by fishing line. They made an interesting centerpiece but we were encouraged to eat the chips. They tasted stale and under salted and they looked unappealing when there were fewer chips on the stalk. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters only asked my husband and I what we wanted as an aperitif - our other family were all in their 20s and it seemed very odd that they were not asked. I asked for a Spumante and my husband asked for a white wine but we were not given a wine list to choose our drinks - which seemed strange. My son and I have celiac disease and my son is quite sensitive to cross contamination. The restaurant provided each of us a rustic earthenware bread plate that apparently they do not wash. My son's plate, mine and my daughter's all had crumbs on them. My son sent for a fresh one and my daughter and I brushed ours off with our napkins. We received an amuse bouche that was a crostini with a fish topping and a macaron with liver pate in the center. For my vegetarian daughter they swapped the liver pate for a cheese filling. For the crostini they swapped gluten free bread for my son and I but they served the fishy crostini to my daughter and wisked it away with an apology but no vegetarian replacement. When they served my son his crostini it fell of the serving plate onto the table cloth. Instead of cleaning it up and bringing him a fresh one, they found a fork and spoon and popped it back onto his plate without much apology. Later, when we had ordered red wine for the second courses my son was provided a glass with 2 chips in it. They wisked the glass away and brought a new glass with the wine in it - without showing us if they poured it through a filter or anything to prevent any small pieces of glass inside. They should have thrown it out and offered us a new bottle of wine. The waiters left us a very long time with no water. They did not check back on us and left us for very long stretches. We were left so long after they removed the second courses that we were upset and asked for the check without any desert or coffee. They did not bring any petit fours or ather parting treat as is customary at this level of restaurant. This was a truly disappointing meal.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "service", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "abysmal", "category": "SERVICE#GENERAL"}, {"aspect": "food", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "abysmal", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "not memorable", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "pasta chips", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "not memorable", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "rocky", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "spumante", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "does not improve", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "white wine", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "unappealing", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "waiters", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "unappealing", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "NULL", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "unappealing", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "spumante", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "unappealing", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}, {"aspect": "white wine", "polarity": "negative", "opinion": "unappealing", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}]}

Although they were still technically closed, the maitre d' graciously asked us to come in and brought us each a small bowl of potato soup, since it was a bit chilly, quickly followed by a glass of prosecco. A very nice touch.We ordered the tasting menu, and you would be hard pressed to find such an excellent meal for the price anywhere, let alone in Rome. The food was delicious, the service was attentive but not overbearing, and the decor was crisp and clean but not ostentatious. Across the board, the whole dining experience was top notch.The potato soup, prosecco aperitif, crispy fresh breadsticks and crusty local bread, bottled water, 3 tasty (if a bit small) appetizers, a wonderful main fish course, berries and custard prepared table side for dessert, coffee, and a limoncello digestif. Oh, and a nice bottle of DOCG Trebbiano that complimented the fish very nicely as well. 80 Euros for the two of us, no extra charges.

While I appreciate, understand, and empathize with the workers of these restaurants (have worked at incredible restaurants myself and have trained with 3 star Michelin chefs), I can't begin to say how frustrating my experience tonight at La Terrazza was.First, I will tell you the food, service, presentation, and overall experience during my entire meal was incredible and I can clearly see why La Terrazza earned the Michelin star they have. I wish I had written down the name of my server at the restaurant, because he was amazing and exemplified what the service we would all expect at a restaurant that has a Michelin star. That being said, let me tell you about my experience with the host of the restaurant.I booked a dinner with my new fiance to celebrate her birthday - two incredibly exciting and joyous events wrapped into one fine dining experience. I emailed the restaurant ahead of time (communicated with Daria at the restaurant) to secure a window seat at the restaurant to enjoy and experience all that is beautiful with their absolutely incredible view of the city of Rome. When I arrived the host seated us at the back of the restaurant. When I let the host know the restaurant had graciously emailed me ahead of time and confirmed a window seat (so I could surprise my fiance on her birthday), he told me I was wrong and they were full. I let him know the restaurant emailed me and secured a window seat (with a signed letter for their cancellation policy and a credit card confirmation) in advance. He then went ahead and printed out half our email exchange and brought it to the table I was sitting at with my fiance and tried to call me a liar for saying the restaurant told me I had a window seat. I then showed him the email where the restaurant said I had a guaranteed window seat, he then turned to the second page of his print out and said ok and escorted us across the restaurant to the corner and seated us near the window.This was incredibly frustrating to have my honesty and integrity called out by the host, with partial print outs of an email exchange - like, that is so crazy. I tried to enjoy the rest of my meal (that we paid over $600 for) and then at the end, he came to my table and said, \"Please pay your bill now, we have other people waiting for this table.\"While the food, our server, and most of the overall experience were fantastic, the host experience made me never want to eat at La Terrazza ever again.

Didn't even get to react - there was simply no time. Stared in disbelief and contemplated life for a bit. No matter if she actually believed I was done or not, this felt incredibly rude.Paid and left - could not be bothered making a scene about the 2 bites left, but I left with a sour taste in my mouth.

We ordered a bottle of Montefalco red. Our main courses were Carbonara (mine, and it was TO DIE FOR!), pasta with ricotta and tomato, and pasta with greens, chilli and garlic - the restaurant's signature dish. We all tried each others' dishes and everything was great. We had some grappa and coffee to end, and left completely satisfied. We had a reservation for 9:00pm but one of our friends was running late, so we didn't really order until about 10pm - the staff was very nice and understanding about it, despite the restaurant being busy and full.

What we like are places that are cosy, have a good atmosphere, where waiters are friendly and attentive but not overbearing, and the food is tasty, plentiful and good value.Ai Cocci had everything we liked and so we are happy to recommend this great find to anyone looking for somewhere fantastic to eat out. We\u2019ve added a photo of us with Max, our waiter, because sometimes it is important to leave a good review when you go somewhere or meet someone who shares or exceeds your own expectations.
