Mary C,"A Roman institution, still going strong. Grab a table!","We had dinner visited here two nights ago for a family dinner. We had previously visited seven years ago. Still an excellent restaurant, although much more quiet with the post Covid landscape. We shared stuffed zucchini flowers as an antipasto and another courgette pasta as a main course.Both were absolutely excellent.We also enjoyed a great tiramisu, the second best of our time in Italy!.2 excellent glasses of wine at €6 each and the whole thing came in at under €35.Renato e Louisa is a Roman institution.

"kathrynlvanceNew Albany, Indiana",Already dreaming about going back!,This was one of those viral hits that I knew I needed to try and the wait (about an hour at prime dinner time) was so worth it.

Dylan J,Average experience — Misled by high reviews,"We were excited to go here based on such high reviews, but our experience was average.Food wise, we thought it was good, but not special. The ravioli was particularly off, with a floury tasting filling, and a Cacio e Pepe sauce missing most of the Pepe. Both entrees were fresh, though fairly one note, bread a bit stale, and pistachio cake desert too sweet for our taste.Service was fine, our waitress in particular was attentive, but the boss was unaccommodating . We made an early reservation hoping to sit on the roof terrace, but were seated at a table right next to the kitchen door instead. When we asked to be seated outside, the boss replied that the terrace was full, even though we saw empty tables. If you do want rooftop seating, be sure to make that very clear in your reservation.Also, after reviewing some of the reviews before writing mine I was surprised to see the restaurant replying to some of the more critical ones in quite hostile language saying they were wrong, and being quite defensive. That does not speak well imo, and matched the vibes I was getting throughout.",3,2022-06-20,VII Coorte

Sadly, and there were a good number of us, general consensus was that it was all a bit insipid. We tried just about everything on the menu. The dumplings with beef and pepper were really good but the rest was just average. The chairs are packed really close together and the noise level is considerable. A bit of a let down really.",3,2019-02-04,Dumpling Bar
"GrzesiekS17Wroclaw, Poland",OVERRATED,"The biggest disappointment of the trip to Rome.

grahamhZ2943VY,Wonderful breakfasts at Rosemary!,"We’re at the end of our second of three weeks based in Rome and have enjoyed breakfast at Rosemary five times so far. We’ve tried numerous other local cafés and keep coming back to Rosemary because it’s such a lovely experience. The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly, the food is wonderful and affordable, and the restaurant is cozy and clean.The owner, Marco Varano, is a gregarious host. He works hard to ensure that his guests have a great experience at his restaurant. Beyond its excellent food, convenient location, comfy chairs, and free wifi, Rosemary is a popular local hangout because of Marco himself. On numerous occasions, Marco went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and well-cared-for: going so far as to repeatedly seat us at “our table” (one of the prime large tables by the window), to bring us free espressos, and even to give us free Nutella cake on one occasion. I’ll be sure to recommend Rosemary to all my Rome-bound friends and family, and will add Rosemary to our Airbnb’s list of outstanding local restaurants. My friends and I will certainly return to Rosemary several more times before we leave Rome, and will make a point of coming back whenever we return to the Eternal City. When we do, I know Marco will greet us like old friends.",5,2021-10-25,Rosemary - Terra e Sapori

EnterQuery,Very good,"I normally shy away from seafood (because I've gotten some horrendous dishes) but the reviews of this place convinced me to give it a try. My girlfriend and I started with some charcuterie, followed by the grilled bass, spaghetti vongole and grilled veggies. Everything was sublime, we were completely stuffed, would recommend.

"David MSydney, Australia",As long as you don't want coffee,"There's something a bit try-hard about Matermatuta. My ”sesame encrusted"" deep-fried prawns (prawn cutlets, as they're called at the local fisho) were fine, but the dipping sauce, a soy and sweet-and-sour combination, wasn't a success. And given that monkfish has a delicate flavour, swamping it with a puree of smoked potato is an idea that needs rethinking. (In fact, smoked potato verges on lunacy.) Still, my wife's scallops were wonderful, and so was the sea bass she had as a main. The dessert of gelati served in the shells of the fruits​ and nuts they were made from was spectacular.All in all, we were pretty happy as we waited for someone to take our order for coffee and grappa. And waited. And waited. For forty minutes. In desperation, I got up to look for our waiter. He walked straight past me, avoiding eye contact. So we left.What went wrong? Some crisis in the kitchen? Did we offend somebody? Or is it just one of those restaurants that loses interest when they feel they've finished with customers? I have no idea. But there's a big element of theatre in dining out, and as in the theatre, a bad ending can spoil the whole night. My rating reflects that. For food alone I would give Matermatuta three stars, with an extra half star for the gelato.Give it a go for a reasonable seafood meal. But if you want coffee, take a thermos.",1,2017-06-01,Matermatuta
Daniel W,Average,"Was recommended this place, seemed overly busy and menus had to be shared.

"dreeveswfgBrentwood, Tennessee","Go for the pizza, hang out with Augusto! ","We stopped by this quaint establishment on our last day in Rome. We had some time to grab a quick bite before doing a little more siteseeing. The pizza was visually enticing to say the least. I ordered a vegetarian, & my husband ordered one with prosciutto and burrata. We decided to sit and eat and ended up having a great conversation with the owner Augusto. The pizza was great & Augusto was SO friendly and welcoming. He gave us many travel tips, & a fascinating history lesson on his building alone. He then brought us the Roman staple, suffli (rice ball) to try & it was also amazing. We were enjoying ourselves so much we decided to forego our sightseeing & just spent our final but if time in Rome enjoying the food at Romana & the company of Augusto",5,2021-06-04,Pizzeria Romana Al Taglio
KelliSul12,A must in Rome,"I should have known from the first bite of focaccia that this place was going to be good. We started with an artichoke salad drizzled with Parmesan and olio. The main attractions: amazingly tender veal that fell apart in your mouth and gnocchi in a seafood medley, that was the perfect balance of salty and savory. Lastly, the Tiramisu, which usually has an off texture for me, was wonderfully whipped and delicious. The pear yogurt mousse was so interesting, but equally as amazing.

"Gooner10-8Dublin, Ireland","Superb Food, Excellent Wines, Impressive Staff...","Just once in a while we get to experience ""Fine-Dining"" at its upper-end : in a Restaurant awarded the acknowledged accolade of a Michelin Star, and - if we're really lucky - very rarely, one which has earned several such awards. The up-market venues we've visited, in Ireland, the UK, mainland Europe & the U.S. have been generally excellent, but we did have extremely disappointing experiences in a 2* in London, and a 1* in Washington D.C.Now, this time around, we were celebrating the Birthday of M (my ""Better Half""), and we had very high expectations of ""La Pergola"", on this very special night. We were absolutely delighted with our experience at this superb Restaurant.""La Pergola"" is part of what's on offer at an elaborate Waldorf-Astoria Hotel/Resort, on Rome's outskirts. To be honest, we did not relate well to the elaborate, colourful but distinctly ""faux"", somewhat tasteless, surroundings in the enormous Lobby area, but from the time we reached the 9th Floor (where the Restaurant is located), things improved greatly.We were pleasantly received, and the courteous Maitre d' brought us to a Table which had great views, for all that it was, unfortunately, a dreadfully wet evening, where visibility was quite limited.We moved on, savouring all the elements of this experience. I have quite a few ""Food Sensitivities"", and had notified these (twice) in advance - the message had clearly been received, to my great relief.For people like us, who have eaten in establishments ranging from humble Cafes, to the far more elaborate, there are some fascinating (and somewhat amusing) elements to dining at this level : for example, you don't just get a comprehensive Wine-List (here there were 2 large volumes), but also a ""Water Menu"", offering options from various countries. Moreover, aside from the seductive list of choices on the Food Menu (here there's an 8 or 10 Course ""Gourmet"" offering, or you can pick from the range of Courses, as an alternative), you also have the added bonus of artistically presented, extremely tasty, Amuse-Bouches.From our Food selections, probably the better ""Appetiser"" was the ""Duck Foie Gras with Pear & Ginger"" - beautifully presented and subtly (rather than aggressively) flavoured. M was very disappointed with her ""First Course"", a Risotto, which she considered tasteless, and didn't finish - in fairness, the Maitre insisted she have at least a small portion of one of the Pasta alternatives, which she quite enjoyed.Our ""Mains"" were truly excellent. M's ""Leg of Lamb with Goat's Cheese & Brocccoli"", and my own ""Fillet of Veal with Chard"" were both remarkable in terms of texture and flavour.As we both savoured the wonderful Food, we also sipped some Wine : we shared an absolutely excellent Bottle of ""Falanghina"", while M also enjoyed a half-bottle of a ""Red"" she selected with some advice from the Sommelier - we both appreciated the distinctive ""Riedel"" Glasses.Nowhere, as we have discovered is absolutely ""Perfect"" : there was an excessively long delay in dealing with Desserts - we felt we had been forgotten ; there were similar problems with getting Tea & Coffee.On the other hand, the Restaurant gave an extremely nice, tasteful, discreet recognition to M's Birthday, which I had signalled to them in advance.Now, it would be utterly negligent on our part, not to mention the enormous contribution that Staff members made to our enjoyment of this special evening. We know only too well that there's a (very) delicate balance between being coldly ""professional"", and offering a warmer service, totally competently. All of those who delivered our Food & Wines were definitely professional, but more than that.We must give special mention to the Maitre, Simone, who was, from the outset, assured, helpful and friendly ; our Sommelier, Alessandro, was not just knowledgeable, but impressively avoided the all too frequent, irritating tendency to act as if Patrons know nothing about Wines - and, as he pleasantly and warmly engaged with us, he even displayed a sense of humour!Our Bill/Check was by no means inexpensive, but we did not expect otherwise. My last note to myself on the night says : ""We've been in equally rated Restaurants before, but this one particularly registered with us, for all the best reasons""!""Grazie Mille"" to Simone, Alessandro + all their colleagues who looked-after us so, so well!",5,2019-06-06,La Pergola

"hotpupNewcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",Absolute gem of a place ! Book to avoid disappointment.,"Booked this restaurant based on the reviews for the 4 evenings that we were staying just down the road at the Republic Hotel. Was not disappointed! Food, service, and ambience were all fantastic. There are several restaurants in this street but this one was the only one that had queues of people who hadn't booked lining up for tables to become free. Food well priced and house wines were a bargain.The meat, seafood, and cheese platters for one on the starter menu are massive and would easily do 2 or 3 people so please beware if you want to manage a second course.Baked artichokes were divine. Interesting range of pasta and pizzas as well as more rustic authentic Italian dishes. Wide range of tasty vegetarian meals.If you are staying in the area and want an excellent restaurant after wandering aroud Rome all day this one is an absolute gem.Best book to avoid waiting in a long line you will not be disappointed!",5,2023-04-03,La Famiglia

I never complain but proactively need to come here to call out the waiter Amir for his awful behaviour and how he treated our group. When we arrived and asked if they had a table for 4, he asked if we had a reservation and I said no. He laughed in my face and said nothing else before walking off to check. He then barely spoke to us and just acted as if our presence was inconveniencing him the entire time we were there. We didn’t get cutlery, he didn’t order one of our dishes (because he didn’t repeat our order back to us to check and ran off) then didn’t even apologise for missing it, so my friend didn’t even get his food.Absolutely appalling attitude.

A lady was particularly rude and made the experience unwelcoming with her tone and demeanour. What appears to be the manager dressed in all black and glasses adopted this manner and didn’t even show us to our table, ask us what we would like to drink or give us our menus. We were given bread, to which we still hadn’t had plates to eat the bread by the time the main course arrived. Only seemed to be one staff member a lovely gentleman with glasses who was working so hard seemed to be doing everyone’s jobs. He was very pleasant.

They have long tasting menus including vegetarian at around €40 for two although we went for a lamb curry, chick pea, spinach and lentil dishes, paratha and rotis, all very acceptable. It's always tricky getting a good curry outside England so good on them. If you like your curries a l'anglais you might want to ask them to spice them up or go for a hot dish - if anything they were a bit mild for us.

A small and cosy bar with great decor and furnishings and despite its size the bar offers plenty of seating options. Beerstyle offers a great meal menu particularly their burger offerings which look awesome,they also offer a really well thought out craft beer selection both on draught and in bottles served by staff who are really knowledgeable about their beers. We were here on a Friday evening and after a quick study of the beers on offer i opted to start with my favourite beer which was a nice bottle of Duvel Moorgat Brewery Duvel Beer 8.5% and this delicious strong bottled beer was just a joy to drink,it's a beer to savour and never rush but being in such a wonderful bar why would you want to rush anything.I love classic Belgium beers and beers such as Duvel are such a nice change ,it's a beer packed with taste and despite it's strength is a beer that is very easy to drink.After my first beer I decided to try one more and again opted to have a classic Belgium beer and opted to have Brasserie De Chimey dorèe ( gold ) 4.8% and again this lighter beer was again served in absolutely perfect condition,I just chilled out and soaked up the great vibe while enjoying some quality beers in such a cool and popular bar.My twin brother Stephen and I had a great time in here were we enjoyed some great beers before we moved on and for a first time visit to this place we were very impressed with Beerstyle.Beerstyle is super easy to locate by jumping the metro down to stop Mirti were you walk Down Via Dei Platini were you will find this bar.Opening hours are;Monday to Sunday,open from 6pm.

The card machine stopped working so the meal ended with me being escorted to a cash machine so did feel a little like had been naughty and I would have thought a free drink would have been in order.Overall a good experience and if you like fish and seafood it is great - if you want meat forget it - they don’t have any,4,2024-03-11,Sa Tanca Crostaceria

SamanthaWats99,A place that makes you feel like family!,We walked here from a long day of touring Vatican City & we were greeted with open arms. They sat us down & wanted to provide us a true Italian experience “no tourist food” and they certainly delivered. The Carbonara was the best thing my family has ever eaten. The basil pesto pasta was also next level you can truly taste every ingredient. The desserts were out of this world the lemon sorbet truly refreshing! Not only was the food excellent but the wait staff was excellent & didn’t make us Americans feel out of place in fact they did the opposite & we felt like family when we left. Truly cannot recommend this place enough!,5,2023-10-13,Osteria Corsetti 1921

51015lukasz,Would recomend for everyone staying in Rome,"Together with my wife we went to this wonderful restaurant during our stay in Rome. The first expiriance was so amazing that we decided to come back to this place. During our 6 day stay we went here in total 4 times. This should speak for itself. The food is of high quality and prepared from high quality ingredients. You can definitely taste that while eating here. The waiters were very friendly and helpfull in chosing the wine during our first visit. We were taken care of by the waiters like we were old friends. Whenever you visit Rome you should atleast go there once to taste the delicious pasta. When we will be coming back to Rome we will definitely come back to this place. It may sound silly but when we were there on our last evening we already knew that we will miss this place and we were sad that we won't be able to come back here sooner.PS.

"YombeDallas, Texas",Best Indian Food EVER! In Rome?!!,"My husband and I were on our way to a restaurant that our hotel recommended when we passed in front of Bombay Ristorante Indiano. We thought, ""Why not?"" and we were glad that we took the risk. Top-notch from the second we entered. The kitchen's aromas awakened our taste buds immediately. We didn't know we were about to have the best Indian food of our lives: complicated, multi-layered flavors with beautiful presentation. Spiced to order; we asked for ""medium"" heat. Excellent, attentive service. Out-of-this-world mango gelato (of which we are still dreaming.) This was the best Indian food we've ever had anywhere (NYC, London, Dallas, San Francisco, etc.) and probably the best of ANY kind of food we have ever had anywhere.

We had the 1kg steak to share with the most beautiful porcini mushroom pasta. It was paired with the most delicious red wine. We were treated to limoncello, prosecco and many different sweet treats on the house. I can honestly say, it was the most delicious meal I have ever eaten and if you don’t go here, you’re missing out. We watched as many people returned (local and tourist) and revisited this restaurant and you can see why. Friendly and amazing service with incredible food. It is an absolute gem in the heart of Rome. We paid our bill, then decided to stay for more drinks … safe to say we loved it so much we stayed for 5 hours.

Culture702919,GF meal on a Saturday night,"We chose this place after visiting the botanical garden, as it is not too far and I got intolerances to gluten dairy and albumen. We got gf pizzas, both of us, even my friend! and we both got gf beers, they only had gf Peroni available last night, and they were ok. Pizza was nice, tasty, thin enough, well cooked, not underdone as it can happen on Saturday nights, and the place was packed! We witnessed at least 2 turnovers of the table besides ours! The place seems small but it deceives you, it is big, comfortable, nicely decorated, well-lit. The girl who served us, Irene, always had a smile on her face, and even complimented us for finishing up an abundant dish of Scugnizzielli nutella, which were fried pizza dough with a vegan choco spread... despite eating the whole pizza, we gobbled all of it!! So crunchy, so light, so chocolatey! Definitely worth a second visit (and maybe try the restaurant menu) especially cause it is so rare to find a gf vegan dessert I can have, when eating out!! Booking recommended, as when we left, at around 10pm, there were at least 20 people queueing outside!",4,2023-12-17,Mama Eat Roma Trastevere

Take one of the homemade desserts, this time it's your grandma who couldn't make it better. Our two younger kids were happy with bread and nutella. If you want to beam you up, take a Grappa (not on the menu), take the barrique-version, it was large and great. After all we got a teaser of the homemade limoncello which was also really delicious.

Started off the the fried artichoke with fondue sauce (genius) and squash blossoms filled with mozzarella & anchovies (delicate and non-greasy).

We asked for a table and got seated outside without being handed a drinks or food menu. The manager behind the bar whistled for one of the waiters to lead us to our table and we were able to make out that the manager pointed out to his staff that we were english tourists. From this point on it all downhill.When the waiter came outside to take our order we asked for a menu to which he tutted and huffed at us, stormed back into the bar to get us menus and threw them on our table.In addition, the staff were making gestures and calling me names that were quite easily transferable to english, in particular, the large waiter who was quick to cause unnecessary problems when i was just trying to speak to them politely.

"envol28Chicago, Illinois",Disappointing,"Hate to kill the buzz created by other reviews, but I was very disappointed in this restaurant. So happy that it was in the same block with our apartment, we stopped one morning for coffee and snack. First off, this appears to be a self-serve place, though the prices are consistent with a regular restaurant of this kind. What had shocked me initially was the fact that the beautiful trendy bar-height tables were covered in food leftovers and croissant flakes. Even my 5 year old daughter exclaimed: Mommy look, someone ate croissant here! Two young gentlemen working there didn't seem concerned about it at all. Cappuccino they made was barely warm. I asked for a salad to go, when opened an hour later, all lettuce was saggy, but the majority of salad consisted of sliced carrots. I do not recommend this place.",1,2016-05-15,My BagS

The owner’s wine recommendation spot on. As I don’t know much about Italian wines except the super Tuscans, he recommended a Pino Negro from Northern Italy and he’s been spot on.

Food was beautiful, Mia really enjoyed the chicken curry and I had the Rogan Josh that we both shared with Jack. The food brought out was hot and spices were just right.

"Kate CNew York City, New York",good food by Trevi fountain.,You can make a reservation ahead on trip advisor (the fork). It is around the block from the Trevi Fountain so very busy with people but was sat right away with the reservation. The pizzas are reasonable priced and easily shared even though some people ate one each. They have affordable wine by the glass and bottle. The staff is very nice but the place is rather casual and a bit loud but tables are decent size and comfortable chairs. They have limited seats outside but a decent sized dining room and excellent food.,5,2023-10-06,Pizza in Trevi

The decor is nothing special, but it was nice to have space and a bit of quiet.The carbonara and the cacio e pepe pastas were great. Perfectly cooked with flavor.The pizza was ok. Prices were adequate for the quality. There is an inexpensive wine list by bottle or half bottle, but you can ask also just a glass.Service was very friendly, but it’s Europe.

Given my wife's strong allergy to gluten we had already decided to eat here and were very pleased (two dinners, two lunches over four days). That said, the gluten-free pasta was not as agreeable digestively as hoped.

Ordered the carbonara again, and it remains my favorite in the world. Also got the lentil soup, it was tremendous (and huge). For our last night in Rome, we decided to splurge a little and go to a place on the Michelin guide. Big mistake. We should have just come back to Mazze, it was miles better.

As starters we had bruschettas with artichoke cream followed by two pasta dishes. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. This seems to be a popular place, so it would be wise to book a table.

In our 3 days stay we made table 7 our home. We went back pretty much every day. We were a party of 8 and Fabio (the owner) and all his staff couldn’t be more accommodating. Even though the place was absolutely packed but we didn’t have to wait for food for too long, we were entertained and looked after. Not to mention their incredible food (we have tried pretty much everything from the menu) cooked to perfection and definitely with the touch of love from the chefs. Their pistachio tiramisu is amazing. I definitely recommend this place to everyone who is looking for true and authentic cuisine with amazing service.Thank you Fabio and the team.We will be back!!!!

Avia F,Disappointing,"Sadly, not a great experience for our last dinner in Rome. We were excited and confident after seeing the high rating and the many good reviews, to the point we thought there is something wrong with us - sadly, we have to agree with the minority of poor reviews we managed to find.The decor is like some describe, outdated and heavy.We ordered the tasting menu at 45 euros per person. None of the food really tasted good, but it was generous - so much so we didn’t finish almost all of the dishes, and those that we did were eaten out of a sense of duty. The raw seafood platter was not to our tastes, and neither were 2 of the appetizers. The other 2, one of them the only hot appetizer served, were just OK. The best dish was one of the first courses, wild rice with shrimps and pumpkin flowers, but that was served too scalding to eat as it arrived and was also left unfinished as their best is not good enough. One of the main courses (both “fish of the day”) was swimming in too much sauce, and the other too dry. The dessert, pineapple ravioli, was just too sweet.To end on a positive note, the waiter was very nice and tried his best.",2,2021-07-31,Sa Tanca Crostaceria

"Lindsay294Austin, Texas",That was interesting,"We did the tasting menu at Pipero and each course was unique and was the work of a chef/artist. The meal peaked at the pasta course, and their “famous” carbonara is incredible. What was weird was the service. The restaurant has only a few tables and each table spoke in a hush leading to this very quiet room with no ambient noise (no music or anything). Be prepared that the staff is polite, but very serious and rigid. Overall, we enjoyed the food but our meal at Pipero was one of the most interesting that we have had.",4,2022-06-05,Pipero Roma
"BranoRscPrague, Czech Republic",Could try little harder.,"Visited restaurant for lunch, ordered 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Food was great but no real invention or surprise. Nicely cooked but was left little shocked with how much frozen produce and frozen fish was used in my dishes as I was sitting overlooking kitchen. Biggest surprise came with basics - shockingly hard and old bread and focaccia that was again frozen and great but over-chilled wines. All wines came straight from fridge and were freezing cold and impossible to enjoy (3 degrees max). Definitely not worth the Michelin star - at least during my visit. What a shame.",2,2020-01-03,Per Me Giulio Terrinoni

He said it was only available by the bottle, I reminded him it was listed on the menu by the glass and said we really like Antinori. I asked if it was the same price point as Antinori and assured me it was similar. Yo make a long story short, when the bill came, I was charged for the Antinori.

"ArthurMinIsle of Man, United Kingdom",Slightly Underwhelmed,"We visited this restaurant whilst on a recent trip to Rome and made a reservation based the reviews claiming it to be one of the best steak venues. That said, we were both underwhelmed by the menu with very few starters and equally few steak choices. €140 would buy a Tomahawk Steak prepared at the side of your table, but don’t go expecting a traditional fillet or sirloin with French fries and veg because it’s certainly not that. Importantly the steak we did choose was cooked to perfection and well presented but that was it, with the exception of two pita breads on the plate, also a first for me in a high quality steak restaurant. The service was attentive and friendly and the restaurant decor clean and modern. Would I revisit, probably not, would I recommend it…do your homework and when in Rome why not.",4,2023-03-03,Ornelli Black Angus Steakhouse

We almost got up and left when finally the server acknowledged us and wanted to take our order. We then had to ask for the wine menu and wait to be acknowledged again.

The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and we enjoyed our meal very much. Would definitely recommend it.

I ordered a cheese appetizer and a main course of some sort of medium-sized fish, fried and very tasty. The other six people were delighted with their selections, mostly some kind of fish, but don’t ask me which ones. The Sicilian white wine was superb, and after dinner drinks, the same and ample. For the first time, I had an amaro called “Amara”, and I hope to find a bottle to have at home. There was an anise liquor chaser that would also be worth a trip to the specialty store.

"CowgirlmomYYCCalgary, Canada","Loved the atmosphere, fabulous service and great meal!","We stopped for dinner at Caramella on our final night in Rome, we wanted something casual with a fun atmosphere. From the moment we walked in, our sever Michele was outstanding! The restaurant was busy, but he squeezed two tables together. After we had our drinks, a better table up and he offered it to us...it was much more comfortable and in a good spot. He didn't have to do this, but it showed his commitment to making it a great experience. His service was excellent, always keeping drinks coming and providing the right balance of responsiveness and conversation. The cocktail menu is extensive and the bartender know his stuff! They even offered non-alcoholic cocktails to our younger daughter that were reasonably priced and fun for her. We al loved our meals - pizza for the girls, the specialty ravioli for me and Caramella's take on stew for my husband and all of us were happy. We also had a few appetizers that were delicious. The ""final icing on the cake"" was a great duo playing music that started about half-way through our meal. The duo were upbeat and really good and played a mix of American and Italian songs that had the whole restaurant clapping along. It was a great was to spend our last night in Rome.",5,2019-04-02,Caramella

Quite romantic but a bit on the noisy side in the early evening (we arrived at 19:30). The food was excellent whether taste or presentation wise. The raw fish (crudo) is not to be missed. The lobster catalana is also epic. Fried items are good albeit on the oily side. The personnel is very amiable and know their craft.

We ordered the Pomodoro Spagetti (€9.00) which is fresh tomato sauce with basil. It was absolutely amazing and so fresh and delicious. We also ordered the Diavola Pizza (€11.00) which is cheese and salami. It was so good. We ordered a coke and Fanta and they were €3.50 each. There was a service charge of €3.00 added to our bill. Mateo was our server and he was attentive and he pleasant. His English was good too. We enjoyed having him as our server. Great last meal in Rome!I would definitely recommend you eat here!

"JohnP8016Brisbane, Australia",Falls Short of Purpose,"Four of us (2 adults and 2 children) visited this restaurant. We were greeted by the host with a lecture on the history and goals of the place. We were told that the main taste was fish although there were non-fish plates.I chose a Carbonara. The egg sauce was a little under-done and overwhelmed the balance of the dish. Another ordered Pasta with a marinara sauce. She was pleased with this dish. The childrens choices were acceptable.The children ordered Brownies for desert. This was a mixed blessing. One plate was excellent. On the other, the brownies were less than half the thickness, were too hard to cut without a knife, and tasted burnt. Completely unfit to be eaten.I do not recommend this place. Like the curate's egg it is good in parts. The rest corripts the whole.Pity. Its goals are good.",3,2019-10-05,Schietto Cucina alla Mano

Gil H,Splendid Restaurant and Experience ,"We stayed in the Hotel Artemide and found this special restaurant four floors above us. We were skeptical at first with it being in a hotel but were we surprised. The highlight was definitely Maurizio, the bartender, who made some of the best drinks we had while in Rome. Try the Ambrosia Anytime if you are a whiskey drinker. It’s is the Nectar of the Gods as he put it. He wasn’t wrong. My wife had the Tenderloin and I had Lamb Chops. Both dishes were excellent but the veggies could be improved. We had the beef tartare and Ravioli for starters. They were both very simple and elegant. Not the over the top cream loaded pasta you get sometimes in Italy. We will be back. ",5,2023-09-26,Ambrosia Rooftop Restaurant & Bar

My first impression still remain: this is one of the best restaurant in Rome for inventive “new “ Italian cuisine. Every dish is a work of art with the accompanying great taste and you cannot go wrong with any of your choices. My suggestion is, at your first visit, to put yourself in the hand of Giorgio,the affable waiter, he will explain the menu with perfect details and insights. The inside ambiance is modern and pleasant but if you can eat outside, in the evening, the atmosphere is magical. By the way if you want a quiet great aperitif this is the place to go.",5,2019-12-09,Aqualunae Bistrot

"dopey22Old Tappan, New Jersey",Beautiful service!,"From the booking to the service, everything was impeccable. The food however varied. We loved the appertif and the extras provided by the chef. We ordered the three course menu. We chose the squid and octopus dishes as starters. The squid was smooth and delicious. The octopus has great flavor but was a little bit hard. The celery garnish and celery cream sauce went well with the octopus. For the primi dishes, we ordered oyster and veal ravioli. The veal ravioli was flavorful. We loved the horseradish cream garnish. The oysters was a bit disappointing. One of the two oysters was very fishy, almost as if was not fresh. The other was just right. The bed of risotto however was hard. For the secondi dishes, we ordered the lamb with carrot sauce as well as the red mullet. Again, lamb was juicy and perfectly spiced. The cabbage wrapped around the lamb was a nice touch. My friend enjoyed the mullet which was served in a fish consommé broth. As for dessert, wow! The chef treated us to raspberry sorbet lollipops, mini basil ice cream between two tiny biscuits, chocolate truffles (made in house— the lime was especially tasty), and lemon homemade marshmallow rollup. The service is unbeatable. Everyone was attentive. They noticed that my friend did not enjoy the risotto and offered to replace with another dish. She opted not, so they did not charge us for the dish. Very thoughtful! We appreciated that they cared about providing us with a great dining experience. ",4,2019-05-10,La Terrazza
PositivelyNoDrama,Can’t wait to come back!,"Quite a few restaurants in Rome offer great food but where this one stands out is how it FEELS.I used to pop in once a week at pre-covid times, usually for some delicious amatriciana. It’s hearty, it’s tasty and it’s as good as any in Rome.The location couldn’t be any better. Yes, it is in bustling Trastevere but this place is slightly off its busiest streets so you’ll actually be able to hear your own voice. Speaking of that, sometimes they have live (acoustic) music, too.The service is fast and the rates are reasonable. Over the past two years I’ve been served by several staff members and they all speak excellent English.Do yourself a favor and by all means try that amatriciana. Pretty cool limoncello tiramisu, too.

"m0uthfulDarien, Connecticut",Delectable ‘home’ cooking - truly delicious,"So many of the big name places in Rome offer the same, somewhat hackneyed menu: Cacio e Pepe, carbonara, Amatriciana, Roman artichokes, tiramisu——let’s face it, it’s what so many of us expect!, but RENATO e Luisa offers so much more! They do those standard pastas and more extremely well, but this is one if those places you must try the second course and as many of the specials as you can eat! For appetizers on the standing menu, if in season, the squash blossoms stuffed with cheese, dusted by breadcrumbs and baked (not fried!) were melt in your mouth delights. One night of the two we ate at this restaurant during our five night stay, we split deep fried veal meatballs on a bed of celery root purée with a side bowl of a rich tomato sauce for dipping, and a poached egg with a cream sauce and shaved truffles....both delicious! For entrees, hopefully you’ll be lucky enough to be there a night they serve a braised lamb roll stuffed with cheese—-it was cooked to perfection. A veal roast with apricots and Marsala wine which we split on a second visit was equally memorable. I’m told by some very picky foodies, the steak with balsamic reduction is fabulous too. If in season, have the puntarella salad — best prep and dressing of anywhere. Basically, everything is perfect.All in all, this was the best restaurant in Rome.

pgbDublinDublin,Two delicious dinners,"We were staying at the excellent Hotel Villa San Pio nearby. We have tried a few restaurants in the area over the years, but not here. Good reviews prompted us to give it a try.The photos suggested it was a traditional trattoria. Its image has changed, probably prompted by covid. Now it’s the same decor, but more modern tables and chairs.Staff are excellent. Nice atmosphere.The first night we had bruschetta which was OK, bucatini Amatriciana which was delicious, meatballs which were OK and steak which was delicious. Very nice Roero Arneis and Nebbiolo wines by the glass. They have a wide wine list and are happy to have you taste a couple before deciding.Based on the experience, we decided not to risk trying anywhere else for the following evening.Second night we had poached egg and truffle (very good), cacio e pepe (excellent), bucatini Amatriciana and the steak again. Same Roero but a different Nebbiolo (which wasn’t quite as nice as the first night's)It was very busy both nights, with people being turned away.

As with many other reviews here he was amazing! So friendly and welcoming. We were ordering and he asked if we wanted some tequila (this was breakfast time so we kindly declined). Food was so lovely, I had a breakfast special that was €16 which included omelette, toast, croissant, cappuccino and orange juice!! Fantastic price. We decided to go back and have dinner.. as soon as we walked to the door again, we were greeted by Franco - ""hey tequilaaa"" he said remembering us from that morning. He remembered what we liked to drink from our previous order and got us it quickly. We had lasagne and bolognese and it was belissimo  Believe it or not, the next day we actually went back again as it was our final day in Rome and enjoyed some more of their good food.

"chrispm68Roybridge, United Kingdom",Best pizzas that I ate when in Rome.,"We discovered La Prezzemolina after a visit to the Colosseum. It's a small, rustic restaurant. Not many tables, so don't be surprised if you don't get seated. However, don't let that put you off because this place has a fantastic selection of pizzas (including a good range of vegan options). I was taken by surprise on my first visit - I was expecting the stereotypical circular pizzas, and to have them cut with a pizza wheel or pizza cutter - but no; these pizzas are rectangular in shape, and they cut them with scissors - WHO KNEW!! Anyway, the pizzas here are sold by weight, not by the slice, so just show the staff how much you want and they will cut and weigh it. We loved the pizzas here so much that we paid more than one visit during out stay in Rome. I can honestly say that the pizzas here easily beat the ones that we tried in other restaurants in Rome. Go. Try it. In fact, don't just have one piece, try many! You won't regret it.",5,2023-07-07,La Prezzemolina

Wine is nicely paired with either each dish or every other, depending on which package you choose. We came in mid September to Rome for only 3 nights and we are so happy we came to this place, it was very much by chance. Don’t hesitate to give this ambitious restaurant a try, you will leave with a sense of bewilderment and a great story to tell your loved ones.

"dlbla2017Melbourne, Australia",Poor service and even worse food,"I’ve been to this place for a third time having previously been last a year ago. I had enjoyed the previous quality of their pasta and service, however this time was greatly concerned to find the food quality has significantly diminished and that the establishment now sadly is merely chasing the tourist dollar. The calamari entree had literally no calamari and was cooked in a heavy oil that rewarded me with a night of reflux and indigestion for having ordered it. The pasta took forever to come out and was cooked very hard and had no flavor and scant porcini mushrooms. The service was very poor the two wait staff clearly could not be bothered with us. From not setting up the table properly to not poring our drinks, to not bothering to come back and check if we wanted any other orders and not even providing straws for our aperol spritz. Very poor all round service. If visiting Monti suggest you skip this over priced hidden tourist trap and try cheaper alternatives where at least the price reflects the quality. This place certainly is not reflective of traditional Roman or even Italian cooking and service",1,2019-09-13,Sciue Sciue

Google Maps got us near enough to find the place, but as others have mentioned, it was on a side street and nothing special looking - don't be put off. We arrived before they opened for dinner and joined a queue. The manager, a nice chap who spoke Italian, English and French (maybe more), split us up into those with and without reservations and waited to see if we would make the cut after the no-shows. We made it in with just six no-shows :-) - gulpReservations are a must!Once we had won the lottery and got in, the pasta was some of the best we had, probably ever, really! Light and well seasoned.

Their prices are also much higher than most places in Rome and they add on extra charges. However, the service was very nice and the people who work there are very friendly.

"anthonyi692Daytona Beach, Florida",Revisited 6 years later - still amazing,"I reviewed this place in 2017 when it was a great little spot for gourmet sandwiches and handy lunches. Based on my experience I was hoping it had survived the Pandemic and saw that it did. I made my choice of hotels in Rome based on it being open. As soon as we checked into our hotel after a long day and a half of travel, we freshened up and headed there. Our hotel was next door.It changed a bit. It was busier and have fewer sandwich options but a spectacular menu of the best pasta dishes you could want. I mean Michelin quality meals such as Ravioli with pesto. Such a creamy pesto based sauce and delicate and delicious ravioli. My wife had that and I tasted.I was going to have Cacio e pepe when my wife saw the fettuccini with oxtails and I got my order changed just in time. On a scale of 1 to spectacular, this was off the charts! A lot of folk are squeamish about some cuts but put your fears behind and try this.The food is made to order of the highest quality with creative presentations and really large portions for a price much lower than you would expect to pay anywhere in that location.It closes after the lunch rush is (chef and his wife work non stop when open) so go early and enjoy. You may have to wait but hold up the number of fingers to indicate the size of your party and they will get you in as soon as possible. Too often we have found great restaurants that have bowed to the pressure to be a tourist and lost their quality. Stay firm chef and keep serving your high standard beautifully presented meals.",5,2023-11-17,Quel Che C'è Laboratorio di Cucina

It is a tiny place - even looking out for it, I walked past once - with no menu and no table service. As far as I can tell, they serve mainly (perhaps only?) tagliere - what the rest of the world calls a charcuterie board, thanks to the French.It is cramped, but that is part of the appeal. It’s a little haven from the bustle of Rome, where you simply ask at the counter for the size of platter you want and it comes quickly, ideally accompanied by a glass of Italian red. A perfect lunch for one or two people.",5,2023-09-23,Prosciutteria Cantina Dei Papi - Trastevere

"PigachoSydney, Australia",Mixed feelings,"We went early (at 7pm) so didn’t experience the restaurant during a busy period, so it was quiet. Nice waiters, nice ‘organic’ feeling to the decor, the food is definitely not the usual tourist menu, (which is good as pizza and pasta is available is soo many locations in Rome). Entree was excellent, the red prawns were absolutely delicious but the mains were a let down, beautifully presented and innovatively thought through but poorly executed. The fish was dry and the lobster gnocchi, whilst very colourful was bland. The lobster seemed to be chunks of just the shell and the taste wasn’t interesting. Perhaps this is an unusual situation, but for us the meal was average.",3,2019-01-20,Ai Bozzi da Giovanni

Surprisingly the worst meal we've had ,"We were really surprised by how bad this was, communication was part of it and our fault of course as our Italian is not good, although 3 weeks all over italy have not had this experience. Wine, calamari and water was great to be fair, location is cool too but second and mains were truly disappointing given the ratings we'd seen, they did not seem to care that we did not even get what we ordered. Maybe the wrong chef, when manager saw that we did not eat it, he said maybe he should come over to Canada and see what we liked....really? 100 euros lighter now, you might want to roll the dice elsewhere.brutal piece of meat, orderdd a tomatoes based pasta...too bad",1,2018-08-02,Cantina 26

"Liz WPetworth, United Kingdom",Small but perfect family run bistrot,"Having found Rome very expensive and not necessarily worth the cost, it was a pure delight to find the Rione xiv.After an exhausting visit round the Sistine chapel and gardens, we followed the wall of the Vatican all the way round to the Borgo Pio. Do not be put off by the many other restaurants in that street, whose waiters are all imploring one to come in for the best meal in town. Keep going down to the quiet end of the street and look out for a small entrance with no outside tables and only seven inside tables.It may be tiny and does not take booking reservations for lunch,but it is well worth the wait if they cannot take you immediately. Luckily, we arrived early for lunch, about 1pm and were seated immediately. The son of the family was delightful and very helpful with our meal choices. The pork cheek spaghetti was a delicious version of Pasta carbonara and the Prosecco complimented it perfectly. Mother and Father were in the kitchen cooking and assisting when needed for service. How such a small run restaurant can be so efficient with the turnover they obviously have on a daily basis, is a tribute to the professionalism of the family. My husband opted for ravioli which he found excellent and complimented it with a local beer. By the time we left there was quite a queue for what is obviously a popular local haunt and we do not blame them for waiting.All in all we would recommend the Rione xiv to anyone and had we been staying closer and for longer we would have booked to return for dinner. We feel sure cheaper places can be found if you just want a pasta to fill you up. However, the flavours and ambiance makes this our favourite experience in what is an overpriced city with too many disappointing venues, with lack lustre food.",5,2019-10-27,RIONE XIV bistrot

It was just as good as I remembered. Awesome crostini, spectacular pumpkin lasagne, and delicious desserts. I was surprised when we got the bill, but in the opposite of the way when traveling the rest of Italy. Very reasonably priced. Two carafes of wine, appetizers, two desserts, and meals for 4 at about 110 euro. Happy customers. I will return again next time I come to Rome.

You have to try a crisp white or red Sicilian wine from the slopes of Mt. Etna.

Lolasgranddaughter,"7 course seafood tasting menu was a special experience. Call to make a reservation or walk in, as online booking iffy. ","We tried the 7 course seafood tasting menu. They modified the menu for a family member with food allergies, and offered equally delicious versions that were gluten and peanut free. They also accommodated a restriction of another food allergen that is uncommon, and outside the top 9 in the U.S. It was a memorable experience with each course artfully presented and delicious. We really appreciated their inclusive and easy-going approach to modifying the menu for food allergies. That way we all could enjoy the meal. This is probably obvious, but fyi the seven course menu is an experience that requires more time than the average meal. I am glad we took the time for the experience. We went to the restaurant without a reservation, and I explained that I requested a reservation via email a few days before but hadn't heard back. They explained that their reservation request emails do not come directly to them. They were gracious and kind, and immediately found us a table. We recommend you call the restaurant or just show up and see if they can fit you in. ",5,2023-10-25,Ristorante Crispi 19

Simply perfect for any wine lover and all the people who want to learn and taste something new and with place of origin. Food is here to accompany the wine and it works excellent. The ambient is very cosy and oldfashioned, in the best possible way. It is very intimate place with nice music and laid back atmosphere. Massimo, the owner, is the warmest guy in the business - he knows it all and will guide you through your wine and dinner with great precision and make you feel relaxed.

Sadly we were too full for the lovely looking desserts.I had tried to book a table by ""the laboratory"", it would have been great to watch the pasta being rolled and shaped, etc, but you need to book weeks ahead to get that.The service was very good, not fast, because they are busy, but timely, polite and friendly.

The pasta was preboiled and the sauce was so intense that we just tasted it and left it. The worst part was the waiters. They were making such a noise when cleaning the other tables (moving chairs and tables, cleaning plates, forks and knives), that we left the place as soon as we ate the pizza because of the headache.

3kidmomsfsf,"Terrible Service, Dirty Dishes, Dine Elsewhere !","You only have so many nights to dine out on your trip in Rome. Don't waste time here. We wanted a special dinner for our last night in Rome. We are a family of 6 but we are complicated since 2 of us are Gluten Free and 1 is vegetarian. We had let the restaurant know of our dietary restrictions when we booked the table about a week to 10 days before our reservation.This was our fourth Michilen star restaurant of the trip and it was by far the worst. Their service was abysmal, they failed to accommodate special diets and their food was not memorable.  We looked at the options for tasting menu courses but because so many of them either contained gluten or meat/fish we opted to order a la carte instead. There were not 5 courses that we could have all eaten. The meal started off very rocky and did not improve. As we arrived, we were greeted with tri-colored potato chips perched in grape stems suspended from the ceiling by fishing line. They made an interesting centerpiece but we were encouraged to eat the chips. They tasted stale and under salted and they looked unappealing when there were fewer chips on the stalk. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters only asked my husband and I what we wanted as an aperitif - our other family were all in their 20s and it seemed very odd that they were not asked. I asked for a Spumante and my husband asked for a white wine but we were not given a wine list to choose our drinks - which seemed strange. My son and I have celiac disease and my son is quite sensitive to cross contamination. The restaurant provided each of us a rustic earthenware bread plate that apparently they do not wash. My son's plate, mine and my daughter's all had crumbs on them. My son sent for a fresh one and my daughter and I brushed ours off with our napkins. We received an amuse bouche that was a crostini with a fish topping and a macaron with liver pate in the center. For my vegetarian daughter they swapped the liver pate for a cheese filling. For the crostini they swapped gluten free bread for my son and I but they served the fishy crostini to my daughter and wisked it away with an apology but no vegetarian replacement. When they served my son his crostini it fell of the serving plate onto the table cloth. Instead of cleaning it up and bringing him a fresh one, they found a fork and spoon and popped it back onto his plate without much apology. Later, when we had ordered red wine for the second courses my son was provided a glass with 2 chips in it. They wisked the glass away and brought a new glass with the wine in it - without showing us if they poured it through a filter or anything to prevent any small pieces of glass inside. They should have thrown it out and offered us a new bottle of wine. The waiters left us a very long time with no water. They did not check back on us and left us for very long stretches. We were left so long after they removed the second courses that we were upset and asked for the check without any desert or coffee. They did not bring any petit fours or ather parting treat as is customary at this level of restaurant. This was a truly disappointing meal.",1,2022-06-29,Il Convivio Troiani

The pappardella was unique and creative--the pappardella noodles were fused together at the edges and were stuffed with meat. We decided to indulge a bit more and ordered their octopus starter. All the food was excellent. We ordered dessert and we were very glad that we did. The dessert course consisted of a pre-dessert (coconut in a dark chocolate shell), their version of tiramisu, and post-dessert (chocolate creme puff and lemon meringue).

When my main came my wife had nothing to eat, and then she laughed, as the crispy chicken main for me , was just three pieces of fried chicken - tiny green pea puree no vegetables.

The seafood is sourced from a local coastal fisherman daily, it was incredible. You could taste the freshness in ever bite. The waitstaff was impeccable, anticipating our needs before we could ask for things. And the owner is incredibly charming. He engaged with us making sure that we had a wonderful experience.

1Chicag0Chicago,"Cute, great food, inexpensive","A bit hard to find, but worth the effort. Imaginative cuisine. Simple but charming setting.Friendly service. Artsy. Of course, the important thing is the food. It is great--and pretty hard to find good food at these prices 2 blocks from Piazza Navona. (Even harder to find a restaurant in the area where the clientele speaks Italian, not English or Russian....)Had a substantial lentil soup, with pieces of roasted chestnut that added an intriguing flavor and a welcome crunchiness to a good Italian lentil soup. Great Winter fare. A thinly sliced roasted veal in a beautifully flavored red wine sauce was my lucky choice for a second course. My wife's fish in aluminum foil was excellent too: moist with the pungency of olives serving as a foil for the simple pure flavor of white fish. The ""pinzimonio di frutte"" desert was emblematic of the style and quality of the place: pieces of pear, banana and pineapple surrounding a small dish with dark chocolate sauce. Instead of dipping raw vegetables in olive oil (the classic pinzimonio) one dips fruit in chocolate. Fun.The tab for two with 2 glasses of wine was about 60 euro.",5,2011-12-04,Il Desiderio Preso Per La Coda
"108gracemLondon, United Kingdom",Amazing - still talking about it a week later! ,"The food and service here were both incredible - it was the best meal we have ever had and definitely deserves its Michelin star! We both had the set menu 'from the roots to the branches' where each course was fantastic - but in particular the egg and soup starter and the pork tempura, but for me it was all the extras that made it so special. We paid for a six course meal but when you factor in all the aperitifs at the start and the complimentary dishes from the chef between courses it was more like a 10 course meal and although it was expensive it was well worth it for the experience. My only tiny niggle with the place would be that each time we were given a menu, my boyfriend was given the priced one and I was given the unpriced one which seemed slightly sexist as I was actually the one paying for the meal! Although I think this is more of an Italian thing in general and it definitely wouldn't put me off recommending this place to anyone visiting Rome looking for a really special meal.

We booked at 6pm and after two courses and waiters grabbing your plate as soon as you had eaten the last piece of food on the plate, we were done by 6.40pm. I chose against dessert in protest at the alacrity of having my plate removed while my partner was still eating...bad manners at worst and lowsy management at best!The food itself was ok although nothing to write home about. Deep fried seafood starter was tasty and served with a lovely sauce. Our mains were standard fayre and nothing special with one of our dishes warm at best, verging on cool.

"doupnikkaRoanoke, Virginia",Very quaint ,"We had an idea what we wanted before we arrived after looking at their online menu. Unfortunately, when you arrive that they make certain things on certain days. My husband had wanted lasagna, and they only make it on Sunday. I had wanted rigatoni, and again, it wasn't available. My husband ended up ordering a chicken dish that had peppers and chicken in a tomato dish. The chicken had very small pieces of bones, so I constantly saw him removing them from his mouth. I had a pasta dish with small pieces of crispy ham on top. I ordered the Roman salad (just a bunch of lettuce greens), and when i asked if they had oil and vinegar, so point to a dish that had small packages on the table. I'm sorry, but when I travel to Italy I am expecting to see a bottle of each on my table, not throw away packages. My husband asked for baked potato, and he got what we call home fries. I guess a different name in a different country. I saw an advertisement in Rome, a drink called a spritz, so I gave it a try. To me, it was just ok.

The secondi were also top: saltimbocca alla romana and a unique dish of cicoria e guanciale ricoperti di scamorza sciolta in padella. Delicious!

"DavidR12877Boston, United Kingdom",Amazing food and great service. ,"I am incredibly pleased with this venue, on entering we looked a little lost not quite knowing how things worked, the man behind the counter welcomed us and spoke with us in very good English, he was so helpful and couldn't have done any more for us, he cut us a selection of pizza slices and told us to choose a drink from the fridge. There was a nice selection of different beers so I tried one of those. The selection of pizza was unusual yet amazing at the same time, there was the standard tomato and mozzarella, spinach and oil, potato and mozzarella and my favourite mortadella in between pizza dough which was superb. The waiter also brought us a sample of just the bread with a little oil and sesame seeds. After all this we were offered deep-fried rice balls in various flavours, unfortunately I was stuffed by now but my friend tried one and he really enjoyed it. All of this cost just under 17€ for both of us. Good food at a great price with ***** service well done. ",5,2016-12-06,Elettroforno Frontoni

Simple decor, simple service, simple food.House red wine was very smooth and accompanied the meal organically. Staff was very nice, good people. Prices are great - very affordable. I would recommend the restaurant for a low-key casual dinner. The only thing is that in my personal opinion the ambiance is lacking some music and maybe the lights are too bright. I remember the absence of music background only in a couple of high end three Michelin star restaurants. Here I think it would be nice to play something for the mood, and together with slightly dimmed lights can only improve it adding a pleasant cozy relaxing vibe. Otherwise atmosphere is a bit too cold. ",4,2018-08-23,Casa Prati

When we finally got there, we were seated downstairs in a lively dining room, and our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We ordered some house wine, which was great and of excellent value. To start with, we had the Appetizer Romolo (Antipasto Mole Adriana), with cured meats, buffalo mozzarella, cheese curds, eggplant and zucchini. What an excellent way to start dinner!For dinner, we had Maccheroncini pasta alla gricia (with bacon and pecorino), a grilled filet of beef, and one of the specials, a ""short pasta"" with clams and shrimp.

nyc1163,Outstanding!,"I don't write restaurant reviews, but in this case I felt compelled to do so.I had made a reservation at Chiaroscuro largely due to the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. The restaurant closes after lunch at 3 PM, and reopens for dinner at 7 PM. My wife and I were on a short trip and weren't accustomed to Italy's later dining hours, so we booked the first opening for dinner at 7.We took a leisurely walk from our hotel but still arrived a bit early, around 6:45. Although they were still technically closed, the maitre d' graciously asked us to come in and brought us each a small bowl of potato soup, since it was a bit chilly, quickly followed by a glass of prosecco. A very nice touch.We ordered the tasting menu, and you would be hard pressed to find such an excellent meal for the price anywhere, let alone in Rome. The food was delicious, the service was attentive but not overbearing, and the decor was crisp and clean but not ostentatious. Across the board, the whole dining experience was top notch.The potato soup, prosecco aperitif, crispy fresh breadsticks and crusty local bread, bottled water, 3 tasty (if a bit small) appetizers, a wonderful main fish course, berries and custard prepared table side for dessert, coffee, and a limoncello digestif. Oh, and a nice bottle of DOCG Trebbiano that complimented the fish very nicely as well. 80 Euros for the two of us, no extra charges. Unbelievable.I have eaten thousands of meals at restaurants all over the world; the quality of the food, the service, and the ambience at Chiaroscuro made this one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have ever had. When you factor in the tremendous value, it very well might have been the best meal I ever had in a restaurant.Grazie Chiaroscuro. E buona fortuna per il futuro.",5,2018-12-07,Ristorante Chiaroscuro

Elizabeth C,Asked 4 times to be given the bill!,Quite possibly the worst place I have ever been to. We sat down hopeful but instead waited 25 minutes just to be served. Our food came out quickly but the 2 pizzas were soggy and immediately made me feel sick whilst eating. We ordered water at the same time as our food but this never came. Asked again and took a very long time to come. Once finished with our meal eager to leave we asked for the bill 3 times with nothing for 30 minutes. On the 4th time they brought the bill and it was overpriced for what it was and the waiter was rude. Whilst waiting the 30 minutes for the bill we noticed staff just standing around talking and even one admiring themselves in the mirror. Truly awful service and cannot believe they have been able to have this many positive reviews thus far. ,1,2023-07-22,Il Nuovo Faro

We took 2 starters, 2 main courses, 1 desert, bottle of wine, and 1 bottle of water.Food was ok.The big rip-off was when the bill was presented to us by Italo who is the owner of the restaurant. We calculated that the total bill amounted to €61. However we were presented a bill of €83. The starters had an extra €2 added to them. the Main courses had €2 added to them. The side plate which consisted of only artichokes amounted to €16 (which are in season and very cheap to buy). There was also a cover charge of €2 which was not mentioned in the menu.We confronted the owner and he told us that he will arrange the bill to €73. Then he told us if €70 is good for us. At the end, we decided to give him €70 not to cause any arguments and ruin evening.My advice is. Food is ok and appears to be homemade.

To top it off, it was the least expensive. We had carbonara, pasta of day (tomato with cod - no cod seen, more like seasoning), salad (just ok), and their special potato dish with mozzarella and tomatoes. The bread was also fabulous.The service was good (maybe not exactly excellent) but we couldn't finish everything (dishes listed above for 3 hungry adult women) and our server seemed genuinely concerned we didn't like the dish we hadn't finished - that has happened so rarely I can't remember the last time.",5,2016-09-23,Osteria del Cavaliere

"JBG1Leicester, United Kingdom",Now we know why it took 3days to get an evening reservation,Having read the reviews we called in to book a table but could not get an evening reservation for three nights. Now we know why. When we arrived ten people were waiting to see if there were any free tables.We were shown to our table and had menus straight away and drinks order taken. We ordered a bottle of red and white wines of our choice at 18 euros each. Starters the great salad which was super and the mixed meat/ cream cheese platter. Very generous portions for sharing.Mains Spaghetti Carbonara and spaghetti Ragu plus fresh Brill and sliced roasted potatoes with a mixed grilled vegetable platter. All absolutely superb. Desserts just had the ice creams as we were quite full as the portions were good. With water all up it came to 132 Euros total so extremely reasonable. Add to this great service and a very buzzy atmosphere it turned out to be a great evening dining experience and one which we would have repeated if we were in Rome longer.

Granted the other restaurant may have saved us €10 in cab rides.Started with split appetizer of cacio e Pepe with pistachio. So wonderful.For our entrees my wife had a veal chop, but it didn’t seem right at €19, and when it arrived it was veal meat that was wonderfully braised. Nice and tender and more than enough.I had a special, ravioli with cod, potatoes and rosemary. Great pasta again, but a simple dish. The Service stands out. The manager who was maitre’d and host went over and above to make our 2nd meal in Rome now better than night one. He might be one of the owners.I Picked this place because before of 0 poor or terrible reviews among Americans, and over 450 local Italians reviews, telling me because it is in the suburbs the locals drive sales.Thank you soooo much for a great meal.",5,2019-09-12,Meat

Told the waiter the first time I went ""this is maybe the best carbonara I've ever had"" and he replied ""I hear this every five minutes.""

They were not that busy and we were able to get a table. We ordered:rigatoni carbonararisotto con radicchio, gorgonzola e noci in crosta di parmigianoossobuco al vino rossoinsalata mistaThe dishes were all quite tasty but there were a few misfires: We like pasta al dente but the rigatoni was close to being crunchy. On the other hand, the ossobuco tended to be a bit chewy and probably needed more cooking.The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. We ordered a bottle of Paternoster Synthesi 2017. It was quite good.After dinner, they provided glasses of complimentary homemade limoncello. A very nice touch.A pleasant dinner overall.Service was friendly and attentive.",4,2024-03-09,Il Panzotto

"Jason AHeighington, United Kingdom",Huge disappointment,"After booking over a month ago for our last night in Rome, we arrived to a lovely Italian rustic restaurant which was starting to get busy, we were taken to side room with no one in away from the main restaurant. I asked for us to seated in the main room but were declined saying “only reservations???” We had made a reservation !!! We sat in this side room all night on our own .. why ? We ordered our starters and mains and waited over 30 minutes, my wife ordered a rigatoni with mozzarella and tomato and then had to pick the meat out as it didn't say it came with meat. My rigatoni had three huge bones in it which put me off completely, my son enjoyed his carbonara Our water and wine glasses became empty and I had track down the waitress who could not understand we wanted more drinks - all our glasses were empty. I could not speak Italian and she could not speak a word of English but not understanding we wanted more drinks when we showed her all our empty glasses?? She went and got the other waiter who sorted us out. After waiting over another 30 minutes, my steak arrived, greasy, fatty and not rested but was seasoned nicely, the salad was not dressed either. My potato, pecorino and pepper side order never even arrivedAt no point throughout the meal were we asked how the meal wasWe were so fed up my wife walked into the restaurant asking for the bill as again we had just been forgotten As we left a table of 12 arrived in the small room we were put in - why were put there ? As we left the main restaurant was half empty. We sat in silence and on our own all evening where we could have been in the main restaurant in the lovely atmosphereWe left to see the owner in the picture on the website on his mobile. Perhaps he needs to get back in his restaurant and look after his customers !! Really disappointing Sad end to a lovely week in Rome",2,2019-09-14,Osteria Fratelli Mori

"Matthew AAustin, United States",Lost Michelin star tonight,"The pressure, stress, and hard work it takes to earn and more importantly maintain 1-3 Michelin stars at a restaurant, is nothing short of extraordinary. While I appreciate, understand, and empathize with the workers of these restaurants (have worked at incredible restaurants myself and have trained with 3 star Michelin chefs), I can't begin to say how frustrating my experience tonight at La Terrazza was.First, I will tell you the food, service, presentation, and overall experience during my entire meal was incredible and I can clearly see why La Terrazza earned the Michelin star they have. I wish I had written down the name of my server at the restaurant, because he was amazing and exemplified what the service we would all expect at a restaurant that has a Michelin star. That being said, let me tell you about my experience with the host of the restaurant.I booked a dinner with my new fiance to celebrate her birthday - two incredibly exciting and joyous events wrapped into one fine dining experience. I emailed the restaurant ahead of time (communicated with Daria at the restaurant) to secure a window seat at the restaurant to enjoy and experience all that is beautiful with their absolutely incredible view of the city of Rome. When I arrived the host seated us at the back of the restaurant. When I let the host know the restaurant had graciously emailed me ahead of time and confirmed a window seat (so I could surprise my fiance on her birthday), he told me I was wrong and they were full. I let him know the restaurant emailed me and secured a window seat (with a signed letter for their cancellation policy and a credit card confirmation) in advance. He then went ahead and printed out half our email exchange and brought it to the table I was sitting at with my fiance and tried to call me a liar for saying the restaurant told me I had a window seat. I then showed him the email where the restaurant said I had a guaranteed window seat, he then turned to the second page of his print out and said ok and escorted us across the restaurant to the corner and seated us near the window.This was incredibly frustrating to have my honesty and integrity called out by the host, with partial print outs of an email exchange - like, that is so crazy. I tried to enjoy the rest of my meal (that we paid over $600 for) and then at the end, he came to my table and said, ""Please pay your bill now, we have other people waiting for this table.""While the food, our server, and most of the overall experience were fantastic, the host experience made me never want to eat at La Terrazza ever again. What an ungrateful jerk! Great chefs and restaurants know that it is us, the customers, that make their restaurants successful - and there should be mutual respect between us both.",4,2018-09-08,La Terrazza

We were 4 but had to split so we can get the tables faster. Pasta itself is truly good, but my cacio e pepe was the worst dish I tried during a weekend in Rome.

Usually we would never consider eating in one of these places that are located at the edges of the famous piazzas, ecxept for a coffeee or a drink. But now we needed lunch.We offered a Roman style artichoke portion and some punterella salad to share. I prefer artichokes on Jewish style (carciofi giuda), so I can't say how well this was cooked, but it was okay. Punterella was excellent!For primo I ordered penne all'arrabiata, which is usually a safe choice if you don't know the caliber of the place.

I think we were super lucky on this, as we sat there, the line formed, but we were early for lunch (they just opened) and perhaps the decreased tourist traffic in Rome opened it up a bit. Bottom line though, I'm so glad we did! What an amazing place! My wife had the pumpkin ravioli, we shared the fresh porcini mushroom salad (I hate mushrooms, but this... this really changed my outlook!), I had the fettuccini with asparagus and my Mom-in-Law had the veal.

marcusfschmidt,"Fine burger, weird service","I don't usually care for writing these - as I'm usually very happy with the food and the service after finding a place with good reviews. But, yeah...Long story short - I ordered a burger and their potatoes. Staff seemed quite inattentive (and especially the waitress I ordered with, who just seemed indifferent) - but whatever, it's a street food/burger joint. I don't mind. I got the burger, started eating slowly while waiting for the potatoes. After eating half of it and seeing that my neighbour table - who arrived later than me - had gotten their order of potatoes, I said screw it and just started eating the other half. Was a bit dissapointed, but could not be bothered waiting for it at this point, so whatever. All of a sudden though - with about a fifth or a sixth of the burger left on the plate, the waitress I had ordered with (who had seemed a bit keen on me doing take away and not sitting down) suddenly came by like a ninja and threw the plate /w burger out. Didn't even get to react - there was simply no time. Stared in disbelief and contemplated life for a bit. No matter if she actually believed I was done or not, this felt incredibly rude.Paid and left - could not be bothered making a scene about the 2 bites left, but I left with a sour taste in my mouth. I had to explain to them that I did not get the potatoes, as it said so on their note... My burger was okay - not NEARLY as good as the other reviews make it out to be, but okay.

"BetteSparkRome, Italy","Delicious Pasta and Gracious, Friendly Hosts","I had a wonderful dinner here last night with two friends. Our waitress was called Elena, and she was a real sweetheart. Very patient, helpful, friendly. Thanks for making us feel welcome!Now, to the food- it was fantastic! We ordered three starters: sun-dried tomatoes, spicy peppers stuffed with tuna, and a selection of salumi and cheeses. We ordered a bottle of Montefalco red. Our main courses were Carbonara (mine, and it was TO DIE FOR!), pasta with ricotta and tomato, and pasta with greens, chilli and garlic - the restaurant's signature dish. We all tried each others' dishes and everything was great. We had some grappa and coffee to end, and left completely satisfied. We had a reservation for 9:00pm but one of our friends was running late, so we didn't really order until about 10pm - the staff was very nice and understanding about it, despite the restaurant being busy and full. We were the last to leave, and did not feel pressured at all- we were told very, very politely at the very end that they were sorry but they were closing. It's not often that restaurant staff is this gracious in Rome. Thanks for a 5 Star evening, I'll be back and recommend it to friends!",5,2014-05-08,La Fraschetta di Mastro Giorgio

Caleigh T,Best Indian Food in Rome,"We had grown a little tired of so much pasta and decided to try some Indian food while in Rome. I had read that Indian food in Rome was excellent and they were right. The restaurant is a little bit away from the main train station, but can be accessed on foot. The area surrounding the restaurant isn’t the nicest and can be sketchy late at night. We tried to get a taxi to take us back towards the Pantheon but couldn’t find one. We ordered an appetizer of samosa I ordered the Kashmirvegetable korma which was delicious and had lovely flavors. My husband ordered Chana masala and said his was delicious as well. We paired all of that with ice and butter naan! The server was very attentive. I didn’t see much of the inside of the restaurant because we sat outside, but what I did see looked clean.Overall the food was delicious and a nice break from more pasta.",5,2023-10-13,Himalaya's Kashmir

Greig C,How do you say excellent in Italian?,"I think it is important to note two things about my wife and I as reviewers. Firstly we have both worked in the hospitality industry (my wife did silver service in the kinds of places in the U.K. frequented by celebrities) so we hold everywhere we eat out to the same standards of service and quality we would expect to have given ourselves. Secondly, having dined in Michelin starred restaurants and found reason to complain, we do not associate the tariff charged with quality of food or service. What we like are places that are cosy, have a good atmosphere, where waiters are friendly and attentive but not overbearing, and the food is tasty, plentiful and good value.Ai Cocci had everything we liked and so we are happy to recommend this great find to anyone looking for somewhere fantastic to eat out. We’ve added a photo of us with Max, our waiter, because sometimes it is important to leave a good review when you go somewhere or meet someone who shares or exceeds your own expectations.

The fettuccine is homemade -- i like it with oxtail in a delicious tomato sauce. The grilled liver is also quite good -- get it with a side of puntarelle, a fresh Roman vegetable straight from the market. They also make a wonderful vegetable soup.

The waiters here are so finely tuned to each other and the clientele. It was super smooth and such an enjoyable experience.

"fitzbenedictStockholm, Sweden",Great Italian food!,"Indeed this restaurant serves good Italian food, but not exceptional. I had the amatriciana pasta which was good and then the beef stripes.

caroleU6115RJ,Exceptional! The ultimate Italian food experience while in Rome (even for larger parties). The best service and food.,"My family and I traveled to Rome for Christmas. I made reservations here not quite knowing what to expect and the service and the food EXCEEDED our expectations. The staff each gave us the warmest Italian welcome. Denis, our waiter, was superb. There were 20 of us total arriving for the reservation -10 of us arrived early for the reservation and Denis welcomes us with Prosecco and the best assortment of appetizers (meats, cheeses, bruschetta, the best stuffed eggplant that I’ve ever had, and more) while we waited. All 20 of us were very pleased with our meals. I had the Carbonara and it was hands down the best carbonara I have ever tasted. The pizza and other pasta dishes were delicious as well. If you are looking for exceptional Italian food, with a warm atmosphere, and fantastic service, located in a prime area then this is spot for you. We were also very gracious that the restaurant and the staff were willing to wait on such a large party on Christmas Eve. My family and I will be stopping back through Rome on New Year’s Eve and we will most definitely be returning to this spot to see Denis and have more amazing food.",5,2019-12-25,Osteria Paquino

"KarenPrieto777Gardena, California",La Strada per Roma,"This translates to ""The Road to Rome"". After exploring Rome all morning, the hunger monster creeped in. I went in to check out the menu & drinks they offered and I was interested so I googled a few words here & there regarding ingredients that were unfamiliar to me (in Italian, of course). I was greeted by the bartender Romina!! and so I asked her about some of the meals they served. She was very helpful, patient, and even showed me the meals as they were expedited out of the kitchen by other service members. That was a very kind & thoughtful gesture, so I sat at the bar top with her as she helped me pick my meal to satisfy my cravings. I ended up going for a Focacce with Mozzarella, Eggplant, and Zucchini. My oh my! The most delicious simplicity on the planet!!!! It was sooo good, especially with Vecchio Amaro Del Capo to finish it all off. I was very pleased with the food, her great service, and she ven helped me with pointers about my future journey exploring the rest of Italy & other places around the world. Thank you so much Romina! You were so kind!Time of my leave was exactly 1:11PM so I think that was a nice synchronicity. Until next time!",5,2019-09-09,Zerosettantacinque

"Deno_AVPaphos, Cyprus","Good food, great friendly service, = Happy customers","Our group of twelve having just arrived in Rome in the afternoon wanted a good meal near our hotel. Two of our group made a quick discovery walk in the early evening to see what was near our Hotel. .We settled on this as the Menu had good choices and also a staff member at our hotel said this was a place that was good quality and sensibly priced. We all arrived here about 7.30pm. All were made welcome and seated accordingly. It was about 15*C outside so we elected to sit inside . This is a mainly seafood menu Italian style. We all made our individual selections, mostly pasta variations and seafood choices. The food all arrived in good time together with a two bottles of wines choices for most of the group. Overall the food lived up to expectations. It was generally felt that the food was fresh, tasty especially the bread .No one had anything bad to say about the food. The only surprise that bread is a chargeable item, whereas in most parts of Europe it is free with dips for starters . Other than this unexpected addition the bill was perfectly acceptable. The staff were very attentive to our requirements to please us. This is a place we could definitely recommend to those who want good Italian food with a preference for seafood, well priced in great surroundings.",4,2015-11-14,Sapori Sardi

"George081Helsinki, Finland","Best ingredients, friendly service and definately real Rome cuisine at its best.","Its perhaps a location which you usually wouldnt find by walking and bumping into it randomly. But this definately a place you should go, bookmark in your map, as if you are looking for real local cuisine at its best. Recommendation: Strong Buy! Atmosphere at the restaurant and friendly service is second to none. Only minor detail is that be aware that later on when the restaurant usually gets really crowded they perhaps have too few people serving all the tables and it might take fairly long to make a new order of wine or waiting to get necessary attention to pay the bill - dont be in hurry, otherwise you'll loose your patience easily. I personally can forgive that delay as the food was absolutely amazing and the way were taken care up until that moment was superb. Ingredients which they use are first class and that is the key for such amazing plates they create - whatever you choose to take. Also pay attention on their daily menu, its surely worth to check and waiters are very helpful telling all the details you want to know about the menu. I will definately go back when in Rome next time. For me visiting this restaurant came from a nice tip from my friend who is originally from Rome and that recommendation couldnt have been more valuable as La Fraschetta di Mastro Giorgio is one totally amazing restaurant, located in Testaccio.

"760billaSpring Lake, New Jersey",The best pasta in Rome,"I had always heard that spaghetti carbonara was a classic Roman dish. But, I had actually had better versions of this dish in Sorrento on a previous trip to Italy. That was until I tried the carbonara at La Fraschetta di Mastro Giorgio in Testaccio. At La Fraschetta, I had an absolute perfect rendition of carbonara with bacon that was crisp and not greasy, pasta that was cooked al dente, and a beautiful sauce that was almost orange in color from the organic eggs. And, most of all, the dish was properly seasoned and not over-salted as many other versions are. This is clearly a restaurant where the locals eat and for good reason. They know how to prepare excellent, traditional Roman cuisine. It may be a little off the beaten path, but, it is worth going out of your way for the food. And, as a side note, Testaccio (which doesn't get much press in the guide books) is a wonderful neighborhood to explore.",5,2017-05-13,La Fraschetta di Mastro Giorgio

"Matthew BBaltimore, Maryland",3-Star Tasting Menu Experience!,"Do yourself a favor and try this friendly, yet sophisticated, restaurant that is tucked away on a large set of stairs in Monti. My wife and I had the “Mare” tasting menu (a steal at 55e) and were blown away by the quality and inventiveness of the food. We’ve been fortunate to have had numerous high-end meals in the US, Italy, France, and Spain, and our dinner at C&C ranks right up there with the best. It was that good.",5,2023-07-31,Cuoco & Camicia

"jcataneseColumbus, Ohio",The service stole the show!,"We had a wonderful dinner here to celebrate our last night in Rome! We sat inside, though the outside looked gorgeous as well, just a bit too hot in July. What really made this meal an EXPERIENCE was our incredible server, Rosario. He was so attentive and kind, checking in on us and truly communicating his passion for the food and culture. He took great care to explain details surrounding our wine selection, an even handwrote a list of wines/wine types to try while on the rest of our visit to Italy. We used his list for the remainder of our trip and all recommendations were spot on. While this could easily been just a. good dinner, Rosario made it a memory to we will talk about for years to come!",5,2023-11-12,Ristorante Cotto

"588Bunny22Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","Great food, tense atmosphere ","We went last night to this restaurant after reading the rave reviews on TA and also a recommendation from our hotel. We ordered the zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta and they were just as wonderful as described. So was the homemade rigatoni with a carbonara sauce - although it was a tad too salty for me. The home made bread was good and we selected an excellent bottle of Nebbiolo at a very good price. So the reason it doesn't rate 5 stars is because the atmosphere was very stressful. There were only 2 wait staff plus the owner and they were clearly rushed off their feet. The service was very prompt and efficient, but it felt like they were automatons. No smiles, no enquiries as to customer enjoyment. It was brisk and mechanized - and that's not what one enjoys over a good meal with a good wine. Perhaps a couple more staff would reduce the strain and lead to a more relaxed experience for all - servers and customers. ",4,2018-04-12,Renato e Luisa

The meat was fresh and had just the right amount. Add some olive oil, salt and pepper and it tops off the perfect sandwich.

"NatalieWJHCopenhagen, Denmark",Incredible experience and exquisite food,"This restaurant is so special. We were greeted by the sommelier, and the owner came to the table, to welcome us and explain the menu, as well as the *local* sources of all their ingredients. The dining room is small and intimate (great sound quality) and the food was just exceptional. Each dish (it was Christmas Eve, and there were seven of them, all seafood) was so beautifully presented and created surprising taste contrasts and texture combinations. The staff is so professional, you never feel anyone is hovering, but you always have everything you need. I would highly recommend Crispi 19 for any special and/or romantic dinner in Rome-- we ate a lot of delicious food that week, but this was spectacular and the whole experience just has you floating out the door.",5,2023-01-02,Ristorante Crispi 19

"Luvs2Travel75Solon, Ohio",Wonderful experience,"We were warmly greeted with a nice prosecco. Our server suggested his 2 favorite pizzas and kindly let us know we were ordering too much food. We settled on the 2 types for the table and they even split them ahead of time so each plate contained both types. Hands down, the pizza with mortadella and pistachio pesto is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Even with our server’s guidance, we still had too much food so our leftovers were packed to go. I was heartbroken when I realized our hotel fridge was not large enough. I tried to jam the last bits of pizza into my already full stomach but sadly, I threw some away. It was a pizza I never would have picked on my own and I am so thankful to our server for his suggestion. We also started with the zucchini flower appetizer which was very tasty. All in all, this was a great meal and quite reasonable. ",5,2018-07-02,La Pratolina
"nickg963Barcelona, Spain",Worst meal I have ever had.,"Without doubt, the worst meal I have ever had.I really do not understand the positive reviews this establishment has received, they cannot be genuine. This is our third day in Rome and we have eaten at numerous restaurants and this is by far the worst and most expensive.I ordered the ""Sliced Beef with Mushrooms"" which is basically steak with soggy mushrooms, that would not look out of place on a cheap fry-up. I clearly asked for the beef to be cooked Medium Rare, but, to my dismay, 90% of the beef was severely undercooked. We both ordered a side of ""Baked Potatoes with Rosemary"" and unfortunately, they failed to please. I am confident that my portion had 1 burnt rosemary leaf and no other seasoning. A lack of seasoning seems to be a reoccurring theme as my ""steak"" did not have a grain of salt or pepper on it.The service was pleasant and polite at first, but the waiter's demeanor changed when we did not order a bottle of wine (he even asked why we were not..). It was clear from that moment that we would be treated differently. Other couples around us were receiving complimentary shots of Limoncello, but alas, we did not.What was most disappointing, is that when reserving the table, we stated that it was our 10 year wedding anniversary and I am not saying I expected preferential treatment, but ""congratulations"" would have almost made the evening positive.As expressed earlier, this was the most expensive meal we have had in Rome (~€78 for two main meals and two drinks) and expected an elevated experience, compared to the other establishments we have dined in, during our stay in Rome. This was simply not the case and will not be returning.",1,2023-10-05,La Pentolaccia

"golfpro74Estepona, Spain",Very disappointing experience ,"It's a shame that my review is as low as a two.I called a few times to try to book a table, but eventually found a note somewhere on their website saying they don't take bookings.We were staying the other side of Rome,but I insisted that we go,as it is rated so highly.We were told by a rather flustered waitress that we had to wait, no problem. We got a table outside within 10-15 minutes.The server came back to take our order,and although we asked for Bread and Focaccia to start,my meal and the breads all arrived at once! No sign of my wife's meal though.We asked twice where it was,but it was very clear they had forgotten it!!! I had finished my carbonara as hers was brought out.No apology,nothing.Its a shame as the carbonara was actually pretty good, but the whole experience was very disappointing. Seems like they are trying to get as many people in and out as possible, which sadly means,on this occasion,poor service and a bad experience.",2,2023-06-18,Mimi e Coco Trast
