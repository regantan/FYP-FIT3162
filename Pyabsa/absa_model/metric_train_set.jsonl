{"text": "Being an indian in Malaysia, I grew up eating a variety of Indian food and my partner is from India and knows his lentils, curries and indian breads well. However, we like to try Oriental, Western and Mediterranean food when we go out. But on some rare occasions, we would go back to the roots and try a good Indian restaurant, although we choose our 'place-to-eat' carefully :)This past weekend we were craving Indian food. So after a bit of research we decided to try a small cafe in Bangsar called 'Ganga Cafe'. I was not expecting myself to be awed by the food but that changed the moment we tried the appetizer 'Samosa Chaat'. The sauce with yogurt was a perfect blend of sweet, sour and spicy and the crispy samosa chunks was heavenly.My partner had the Channa Bhatura and it was crispy with a tender texture with chana rightly spiced for our palate. I ordered the Parantha with Palak Paneer (Cheese Spinach) and I enjoyed every bite of my tongue tantalizing food. But the best part of our order was this amazing drink called Pranic Juice which just leaves you refreshed and awake after every sip. It is a mixture of mint, lemon and few other ingredients..Bottomline, if you like vegetarian Indian food you should definitely check this place out. It is delicious and value for money too.

We were greeted professionally by the staff and they all seemed to be fairly knowledgeable on what they offer. We had the 5 course menu and I would rank the appetizers and pre-main to be above their main course. My selection for main course was the steak. Hence comparing to other restaurants which predominantly specialize in their meat, DC would come short on that dish. Apart from that, the rest were great. However, one thing worth to mention is the attitude of one particular staff at the restaurant. We ordered a 2012 wine but when the wine arrived it was a 2014. I assumed that they brought the right wine and hence I did not particular note the year stated on the bottle. It was after a glass which I finally picked up the bottle and started looking at it closely. Only to realize they had serve me a 2014 bottle. When I questioned the staff, he said that they have ran out of the 2014. When I asked him why didn't anyone from the floor informed us, he replied me by saying sorry that they forgot to inform us.

We go up, order our starters (duck pat\u00e9 and scallop/crab salad) and main courses (chicken and pasta) and wait. After a while, a different waiter comes to tell us the chicken is only available for dinner, and brings back the menu. And we wait.... I mentioned that maybe it would be nice to tell the customers beforehand that a dish is not available, or maybe even mention it on the menu, there's an idea, if it's never available for lunch. Not much reaction, the guy takes the menu away without asking me what else I would like as a main course. I decide to let it go and see if anyone notices there is no second main course ordered. I have to mention that we are the only customers at 12.45 on a Saturday. Pat\u00e9 arrives, ok, nicely presented, average taste, and so does my scallop and crab salad a bit later. I start eating it and just cannot find any trace of scallops. I mention it to the waiter, who laughs, goes to the kitchen and comes back to say \"no scallops so we put extra crab meat\". Not the salad we ordered (and of course no mention of the change to the customer), no main course ordered, the Danish chef witnesses the whole scene and does not make a move to explain, let alone apologize. We decide to walk out, ask for the bill for food and drink consumed (it does come with no argument) and as we go out, we mention our discontent to the chef. His only reply (he is very shy or he really really doesn't care) is, we've not had scallops for 2 months... WHY NOT TELL THE CUSTOMER OR TAKE THE DISH OFF THE MENU ??? We told him that we understand that in Malaysia things don't always come out as they should, but a simple explanation or apology would have made things better when there are such blunders. Even better, get organised and tell the customers what they are going to get (or cannot get) before the order is taken... we really felt he couldn't care less... shame as this was a promising restaurant but we will never set foot in the place again. I can understand this level of service in a cheap eatery, but from a restaurant that considers itself trendy and upmarket, it is more than puzzling.

Other dishes will be add-ons to make the meal complete.As for Wanjor, basically, the rice is the same as other places. But to dine in here will make the meal interesting and more enjoyable.

{"text": "Burnt cheesecake is made by the Basque country, particularly San Sebastian where it is said that a little incident by a baker in the kitchen led to the global sensation when the burnt cheesecake has taken the world over by storm. In Malaysia alone, many cafes and restaurants offer this dessert to those with sweet tooth. I have tried most of the places I'd known but the Japanese version in The Tokyo Restaurant, tucked on the 4th floor of Lot 10 KL.. remained elusive as I hardly go downtown. My opportunity came when I had to meet a customer in downtown KL one weekday and I utilised the time in between to give this place a try. There is a lift outside the mall that gives direct access to the 4th floor where many Japanese restaurants have set their foot here. Since it was a weekday afternoon, the place was almost empty so we could dine in peace. The whole restaurant setup was modern and tastefully decorated with warm ambience - perfect to kill some free time and to enjoy your food or dessert or even a cup of coffeeThey do serve limited food such as salad, sushi, burger, etc but since I was there for one thing only, I couldn't comment much on these.I ordered their famous burnt cheesecake - so famous that I could spot many Instagram featuring it. At RM20 per piece, it's probably the most expensive piece of cake I'd ever tried in my life. The cake was served lying down on the plate with a dollop of whipped cream on top. It was soft yet bold, with rich cheese taste that cheese lovers would appreciate, or else it would be too rich for general palates. It instantly melt as soon as it entered the mouth. Perhaps the whipped cream's purpose was to mellow down the cheesiness of the cake and it certainly did a good job at that. Iced latte did its job to satisfy my caffeine needs.. using premium coffee beans hence the premium price charged After that we took a while to look around the refurbished Lot 10 - many establishments such as Sushi Azabu, Dashing Dining Says, etc... That I have not even stepped into yet. Time to discover more about it next time. For now.. it's a yes just to come and taste the famous burnt cheesecake.", "Quadruples": [{"aspect": "cake", "polarity": "positive", "opinion": "favorite", "category": "FOOD#QUALITY"}]}

Breads and pastries were also available and were good. The breakfast also included pancakes and waffles. There were a few problems with the breakfast, and I hope the Mill Caf\u00e9 management will attend to these problems. The problems in the breakfast were as follows;1. At the caf\u00e9 entrance, I had to give the caf\u00e9 reception staff my room number. It looked like he had a printed log of room occupants. He also had a Computer in front of him that he used to print a registration form of multiple copies. I had to write my name, room number and sign this form. I do not know why I had to write this on the form when the Computer had this information and could have printed it. I also do not know why is the whole form needed when he had a log of room occupants. This is a lot of waste and causes time delays.2. The seating area is very dated, with very old carpets. In some areas there is marble flooring instead of carpets. The marble flooring is of Chocolate color (dark brown color), the ceiling panels are of Chocolate color, the tables and chairs are of Chocolate color and the wall wooden panels & dividers are also of Chocolate color. This is very dark and very depressing.3. The made to order eggs station had one cook who would prepare one order at a time, with each order taking the cook about 5 minutes. There were only 3 people ahead of me, but this meant that I would have to wait 15 minutes just to give my egg order. Luckily, another cook came to assist the existing cook to make eggs. 4. For Western breakfasts, there were no grilled tomatoes or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms to go with the eggs. They did have hash browns, by the way.5.

It is not always true but this time, the massive crowd spoke the truth!Despite the crowd, the service staff were excellent regardless whether they were waiters, servers, cashiers or captains. Everyone was attentive, efficient, accommodating, courteous and knowledgeable about the food offerings.The food was served quite quickly and while they were steaming. The roast duck was succulent, tender and seasoned perfectly. The roast pork (siew yoke) was tender and tasty with light, crispy skin. And the barbecued roast pork (char siew) was heavenly; tender, nicely caramelized but not too sweet and devoid of ghastly red coloring.The wantan noodles were al dente and deliciously coated with meat juices. The fried rice cooked in lotus leaves was reminiscent of rustic home cooking; pure comfort food.Other mentionable offerings we had was the steamed pork with salted fish, stewed pork & yam ('kau yoke' so tender, it melted in the mouth!), clam soup (xiong tong lala), stir fried beans in shrimp paste (belacan) and a braised homestyle tofu.That was one of the best meals we have had this year.

And I only found out about this when she directed me to the obscure part of Brickfields where Alila Bangsar (technically the building is in Brickfields area but with a connecting bridge to Bangsar LRT station). \"Atceli I tried to book for many weeks already but it was always fully-booked\" she said. My heart melted when I got to know how she went through the hassle to surprise me, as I know the fact that she isn't very much a planner herself. Located on the 41st floor, we got ourselves a table by the window overseeing Brickfields and beyond. I kepoh a bit and took a look around - the restaurant was definitely full house and everyone was seen enjoying their lunch over chatters. Complimentary bread with kombu butter (which was heavenly by the way) was served as soon as we placed our order. I had to order a second kombu butter because it was so good. So there are two (2) options: 2-Course (RM108) without dessert or 3-Course Lunch Set (RM128) with dessert. Starters  Garlic & Escargot Soup - garlic veloute (soup); vegetable stock; escargot beignet; garlic croutons. So the escargot was deep fried with greenish colour dough on the outside and served on the plate which covered the bowl of soup. The idea was to pour everything into the soup and enjoyed like that. Salmon & Katsuo - cured Norwegian salmon tartare, nage of Katsuo, kombu dashi, salmon roe. Delicious but I could not help but to think that it tasted more Japanese than French. Mains Duck & Potato - duck confit Parmentier, mushroom, mashed potato and crispy tuile. I was impressed by the presentation of the dish. All elements combined well together to make my tummy happy. Butter Fish - butter fish beignet; sauteed pea sprout; mashed potato; pickled pearl onion. I took a bite and still prefer my duck dish. Given the choice, I'd normally go for red meat as main. The pickled onion did its job to cut through the richness of the sauce. Desserts Banana \u00c9clair - banana eclair; 70% single Pahang chocolate cream, yoghurt ice cream. I wouldn't order banana dessert if not for the other half who wanted to try it. Lovely dessert which was not too sweet yet got me wanted for more. Each set comes with complimentary tea/coffee or homemade kombucha (soda).
